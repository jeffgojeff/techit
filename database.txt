bromwell high is a cartoon comedy it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life such as teachers my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell highs satire is much closer to reality than is teachers the scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools i knew and their students when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately recalled  at  high a classic line inspector im here to sack one of your teachers student welcome to bromwell high i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched what a pity that it isnt
scott bartletts offon is nine minutes of pure craziness it is a fullfrontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsyinducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avantegarde cinema theres no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highlyindustrial form of modern technology in a sense the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools his machinery his technology this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey 1968 and indeed bartletts opening sequence of images  flashing colours before a closeup human eye  recalls dave bowmans journey through the stargate the visuals are richlycoloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasinglygrainy video as though were sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact the end product was recorded from a tv monitorbr br there appears to be some confusion about the films release date imdb lists the film as a 1972 release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the films completion and its first public screening either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video and some brisk techno music wouldnt have gone amiss either offon captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information i had a thought  and please dont laugh at this freethinking interpretation  that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earths television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguelyfamiliar imagery that couldnt possibly make any coherent sense perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality
imdb lists this as 1972 for some reason but the other sources ive seen including the excellent program notes mark it as 68 doesnt really matter except that its quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video one of the first art works to merge the two apparently in the context of the star gate sequence in 2001 released the same year pure abstraction isnt really my thing but i can take it in small doses and the supersaturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers rohrschach blots birds etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s and deserves to be better known
i first heard about this film about 20 years ago when i was a kid in grade school it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day and under the entry for movies or cinema i dont remember were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon it really intrigued me since it stood out the most on the page it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over itbr br about 18 or so years later the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole 4dvd set of treasures of american film archives released by the national film preservation foundation so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs after all these years i could finally see the film after viewing it it slightly wasnt was i was expecting it to be it tended to be a more organiclooking film not that thats a bad thing but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic but it was still an impressive film imho considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film including handtinting the film itself and using video equipment for some of the films scenes filmed off of a video monitor giving it a more distressed lores lookbr br dont get me wrong the techniques used in this film were quite groundbreaking for 1972 thats why its still one of my favorite shortexperimental films and a creative inspiration for me as well
when i read other commenti decided to watch this moviebr br first cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli good enoughbr br filmvery intelligence and interesting because cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsiabr br secondstory is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play youll like in my opinionbr br thirdfinal chapter is not special or interestingits regular like other action moviesbr br finallyi recommend to watch this movieand i hope youll love it enjoy d
this movie had an interesting cast it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it you dont need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didnt close down a café to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future
gotta start with ed furlong on this one you gotta god bless this kid 5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what hes really like in real life he has a oneliner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesnt even seem like furlong is even acting maybe thats why his performance was good same with madsen you keep thinking i bet this guy is really like this in real life does madsen even have to act just natural vosloo has obviously moved on from the typecasted mummy guy i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiros performance her reactions are spoton in this film i battled if she was hot or not but realized i would just like to see more of her br br not a big fan of shoot em outhostage type films but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing its not just your standard robbers take over a bank they kill hostages and the good guys win in the end type of film the twists keep on comingand comingbr br the café scenes work best with the handheld cams to show what its really like in there not glossed over a bit think like bourne ultimatum lite style on some scenes in the cafébr br and for those bo bice fanatics out there  actor curtis wayne who plays karl will make you do a double take these guys are twinsbr br as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countriesstates so they might have these accents but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of and some of them are smoking hot moncia dean need i say more
the first von trier movie ive ever seen was breaking the waves sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa europa tells a story of a young germanamerican who wants to experience germany just after the second world war he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train because of his job he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany meeting with the killing of traitors and hunt for former nazi party members the society is suffering from corruption his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called werewolves they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains the atmosphere is astounding the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene just when you think youve seen a lot europe
lars von triers europa is an extremely good film hows that von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story at least he did have with europa to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen even with all the tricks in my opinion this film is the most complete real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list i also think it is perhaps the scariest the most gothic and complete film around all right there are other good ones too but this one is my favorite the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever
europa or as it is also known zentropa is one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen the blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless a true feast for the eyes the picture was a contender for a 1991s golden palm in canners the award went to barton fink by coen brothers a film stylistically very similar to zentropa heres an exercise in class rent both films and be a judge for yourself
this is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art not an entertainment business lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of postwar germany utterly captivating you get absorbed into the dream and youre let go only at the end credits the plot necessarily comes second but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised just wonderful
im a male not given to womens movies but this is really a well done special story i have no personal love for jane fonda as a person but she does one hell of a fine job while deniro is his usual superb self everything is so well done acting directing visuals settings photography casting if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love  this is a winner
this is the definite lars von trier movie my favorite i rank it higher than breaking the waves or the latest dancer in the dark i simply love the beauty of the picturethe framing is so original acting is wonderful a must see
before dogma 95 when lars used movies as art not just a story a beautiful painting about love and death this is one of my favorite movies of all time the color the music just perfect
europa zentropa is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago this film is truly unique and a work of genius the camerawork and the editing are brilliant and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experiencebr br the participation of barbara suwkowa and eddie constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed max von sydow provides his great voice as the narratorbr br a one of a kind movie four stars highest rating
i havent seen this movie in about 5 years but it still haunts me br br when asked about my favorite films this is the one that i seem to always mention first there are certain films works of art like this film dark city and breaking the waves that seem to touch a place within you a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer not unlike a lifechanging event such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend this film shook me when i first saw it it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days
as much as the movie was good i have nothing more to say about it than what was said already all i wanted is to point the fact that the movie isnt from sweden but from denemark maybe i wrong and in that case ill be happy to know my mistakes so take the and notify me
piece of subtle art maybe a masterpiece doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence tale in kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world the life is in this film only exercise of adaptation lesson about limits and original sin about the frailty of innocence and error of his waysbr br leopold kessle is another joseph k images of trial and same ambiguous woman and europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truthessencegolden agebr br methaphor or parable the movie is history of disappointeds evolution war peace business or lie are only details of gelatintime hypocrisy is a mask love a convention the sacrifice only method to hope understanding a painful reality
man oh man ive been foolishly procrastinating not the right term theres a long list to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so and news are marvellous labyrinthine spectaclebr br for any von triers follower both rigets element of crime dogville dancer in the dark the five obstructions etc europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual terms everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic you really get the feeling of being inside this imaginary nightmarish time warp taking from the masters of surreal cinema like bunuel bergman till noir films of the 40s with acidic drops of avantguard von trier leads the artfilm scene as the well intended totalitarian movie maker of nowadays his authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate issues without being irrational hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical worldbr br as utopian as it seems i do believe people like von trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect the day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no longer necessary as a tool for reflection perhaps it could be the start of a new era the age of emotional control over our fears this is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and overbr br bravo
lars von triers europa is a worthy echo of the third man about an american coming to postworld war ii europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mysterybr br jeanmarc barr plays leopold kessler a germanamerican who refused to join the us army during the war arrives in frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the zentropa railway what he doesnt know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called the werewolves who target american allies leopold is strongly against taking any sides but is drawn in and seduced by katharina hartmann barbara sukowa the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company her father was a nazi sympathizer but is pardoned by the american colonel harris eddie considine because he can help get the german transportation system up and running again the colonel soon enlists or forces leopold to be a spy without giving him a choice or chance to think about it to see if the werewolves might carry out attacks on the trainsbr br soon leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noirish way where everyone and everything is not what it seems its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything his lover the terrorists the colonel annoying passengers his disgruntled uncle even the railway companys officials who come to examine his work ethic before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control the film is endlessly unpredictablebr br the film stylishly shot it always takes place at night during the winter with lots of falling snow its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout also background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front add max von sydows hypnotic narration and europa becomes a dreamlike place thats out of this worldbr br this is now a personal favorite film of mine
released as zentropa in north america to avoid confusion with agniezska hollands own holocaust film europa europa this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise inspire or downright shock is a bizarre nostalgic elaborate film about a naive american in germany shortly following the end of wwii the american named leo doesnt fully get what hes doing there he has come to take part in fixing up the country since in his mind its about time germany was shown some charity no matter how that sounds he is not a nazi sympathizer or so much as especially progerman merely mixed up his uncle who works on the railroad gets leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 germanys horrors and enigmasbr br this progression starts when leo played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor jeanmarc barr meets a sultry heiress on the train played by barbara sukowa an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor she seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family which owns the company which manufactures the trains these were the precise trains that took jews to their deaths during the war but now they run a drab daytoday timetable and the womans uncle kessler postures as another one of those good germans who were just doing their jobs there is also udo kier the tremendous actor who blew me away in von triers shocking second film epidemic though here he is mere scenerybr br another guest at the house is eddie constantine an actor with a quiet strength playing a somber american intelligence man he can confirm that uncle kessler was a war criminal though it is all completely baffling to leo americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than leo who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death trainbr br the story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the films danish director lars von trier whose anchor is in the films breathtaking editing and cinematography he shoots in black and white and color he uses doubleexposures optical effects and trick photography having actors interact with rearprojected footage he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects caught between glass for our more precise surveybr br this grand jury prizewinning surrealist work is allegorical but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer i interpret it as a film about the last legs of nazism symbolized by the train and the ethical accountability of americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads during the time frame of the movie and the nazi state and such significance to the train are dead but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexesbr br the characters music dialogue and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions the most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones two trains halting back and forth barr on one and sukowa on another an underwater shot of proliferating blood an uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown and most metaphysically affecting of all an anesthetic shot of train tracks as max von sydows voice allures us to hark back to europe with him and abandon our personal restraint
the best way for me to describe europa which is high on the list of my favourite films is the exclamation that came from a companion after the film ended i didnt know films could be made like that entirely original in its visual style it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be its as far away from the master and coverage style of shooting as one can get perfectly integrating many layers of image sound effects props dialogue voice over performance editing lighting etc all equal none predominant despite hollywoods dialogue myopia cinema is not about dialogue nor is it about beautiful lighting action or music it works best when all the elements are on an equal footing where only the blending of those elements in the order or combination in which they are presented will communicate the idea reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element and the film has no meaning europa is what cinema should strive to be
liked stanley  iris very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie
it is not every films job to stimulate you superficially i will take an ambitious failure over a massmarket hit any day while this really cant be described as a failure the sum of its parts remains ambiguous that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again this is a challenging provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly the problem with the movie is in its structure its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up just as a second ending is tacked on though everything is technically dazzling the movie is exactly too long by that unit the longdelayed climax of leos awakening comes about 20 minutes latebr br great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas the compositing artifice is provocative and engaging a character is rearprojected but his own hand in the foreground isnt the world depicted is deliberate treacherous and absurd keep your eyes peeled for a memorable technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw dropbr br the compositions are stunning whomever chose to release the out of print videotape in the pan  scan format must have never seen it where is the dvdbr br it is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review you should see it at least once you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew but this movie ends up being richer for it i suspect he is familiar with hitchcocks foreign correspondent in which devious europeans also manipulate an american dupe and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does all von trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies after zentropa von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary overrated unnuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark
critics need to review what they class as a quality movie i think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the matrix style of films europa is a breath of fresh air a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film lars von trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension the back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters and the focus of the conversation they are having other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene the commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actionsbr br i could talk about the effects more but i think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own and really heighten the drama of the film a film to buy if you dont own already and one to see if you have notbr br 1010 dont miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors
i had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical genre hollywood film story lines fail and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste but then i saw zentropa europa and my faith was renewed not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating the narrator max von sydow takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into europa 1945 we have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slowmoving moment that leads you to death unlike many films it doesnt cut after one second of showing for example a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a mans final moments i think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means i would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email enjoy it
that was the first thing that sprang to mind as i watched the closing credits to europa make there was across the screen never in my entire life have i seen a film of such technical genius the visuals of europa are so impressive that any film i watch in its wake will only pale in comparison forget your michael bay ridley scott slick hollywood cinematography europa has more ethereal beauty than anything those two could conjure up in a million years now id be the first to hail lars von trier a genius just off the back of his films breaking the waves and dancer in the dark but this is stupid the fact that europa has gone unnoticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema whilst overrated rubbish like crouching tiger hidden dragon and life is beautiful clean up at the academy awards but what do the know europa has been hidden away absent form video stores and until recently any british tv channels br br the visuals in europa are not mtv gloss its not a case of style over substance its more a case of substance dictating style much like his first film the element of crime von trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world and much like element the film begins with the main character or in the case of europa we the audience being hypnotized as we move down the tracks the voice of the narrator max von sydow counts us down into a deep sleep until we awake in europa this allows von trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour von trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot for instance its no surprise that the first shot of leopold kessler jeanmarc barr is in colour since he is the only character whos actions have superiority over the film br br the performances are good they may not be on par with performances in later von trier films but thats just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you dont really pick up on them the first time round but i would like to point out the fantastic performance of jeanmarc barr in the lead role whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides until he erupts in the films final act again muck like the element of crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the continuing narration of von sydow to seal his fate europa is a tremendous film and i cant help thinking what a shame that von trier has abandoned this way of filming since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time europa much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes his dedication to composition and miseenscene is unrivalled not to mention his use of sound and production design but since his nofrills melodramas turned out to be breaking the waves and dancer in the dark then who can argue but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent 1010
contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own riskbr br i loved this film the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen for instance in one scene leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen her face is huge in the back and leos is in the foregroundbr br one of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups it reminded me of battleship potemkin that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtubyou can only see the red water on the side it is one of the things i love about von trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepybr br the use of text in the film was unique like when leos character is pushed by the word werewolf i have never seen anything like that in a filmbr br the use of black comedy in this film was well done ernsthugo järegård is great as leos uncle it brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom riget this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww2 and all the chaos easier to take it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them yet some people like leo are tuned in but do nothing positive about itbr br the voice over done expertly well by max von sydow is amusing too it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leos head which at times is a scary place to bebr br the movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they dont choose a side i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark where bjorks character doesnt speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction actually at one time von trier seemed antiwoman to me by making breaking the waves and dancer but now i know his male characters dont fare well either i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions but of course they never do
lars von trier is never backward in trying out new techniques some of them are very original while others are best forgottenbr br he depicts postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey with so many cities lying in ruins leo kessler a young american of german descent feels obliged to help in their restoration it is not a simple task as he quickly finds outbr br his uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the zentropa railway line his job is to attend to the needs of the passengers when the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles a terrible argument ensues when a passengers shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished there are many allusions to the german fanaticism of adherence to such stupid detailsbr br the railway journey is like an allegory representing mans procession through life with all its trials and tribulations in one sequence leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with halfstarved bodies appearing to have just escaped from auschwitz  these images horrible as they are are fleeting as in a dream each with its own terrible impact yet unconnectedbr br at a station called urmitz leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb in view of many bystanders he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock later he jumps from the train at high speed and lies in the cool grass on a river bank looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock if you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task quite ridiculous in fact it could only happen in a dreambr br its strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the trainbr br despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed i prefer lars von triers later films breaking the waves and the idiots the bomb scene described above really put me off perhaps im a realist
zentropa is the most original movie ive seen in years if you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir then this is just the right cure for all of those hollywood summer blockbusters clogging the theaters these days von triers followups like breaking the waves have gotten more acclaim but this is really his best work it is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor its too bad he decided handheld cameras were the wave of the future its hard to say who talked him away from the style he exhibits here but its everyones loss that he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead
zentropa has much in common with the third man another noirlike film set among the rubble of postwar europe like ttm there is much inventive camera work there is an innocent american who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesnt really understand and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the nativesbr br but id have to say that the third man has a more wellcrafted storyline zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect perhaps this is intentional it is presented as a dreamnightmare and making it too coherent would spoil the effect br br this movie is unrelentingly grimnoir in more than one sense one never sees the sun shine grim but intriguing and frightening
von trier once explained how he created such strong involvement from the viewer with his movies by placing his movie world in about the middle of the real world and the imagined world so as viewers we think we watch a true story while in fact we are thoroughly manipulated often to the point that the movie works disturbing dancer in the dark or painful the idiots idioterne of course the dogmefilms acted only as a vehicle for this theory besides creating some welcome spotlight on von trierbr br the story is typical for von trier our hero is idealistic seems to balance his relations with everybody else but soon becomes the victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves the idealist inevitably has to reject society in order to stay idealistic and becomes the terrorist mankind is spoiled and purity only leads to selfdestruction these elements were also very omnipresent in breaking the waves and dancer in the dark the movie is also full of cynical even humorous undertones about the role of the germans and americans in postwar germanybr br as a technical achievement the movie is wonderfully designed shifting and fading washedout colors screen overlays action on different overlays with the shooting of the soontobe mayor as the most interesting in this movie we can see how good von triers handles film as a technical medium in his later works he seems to step down from this as if he is not longer interested in technical achievements because they become so easily available
with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene the movie plays much like a dream and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices the film works isnt trying to work as history but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies br br i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever and there is a wild imagination in its style i can completely understand why people would hate it but i give it 910
liked stanley  iris very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting arrangement the absence of violence and sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie
on october of 1945 the american german descendant leopold kessler jeanmarc barr arrives in a postwar frankfurt and his bitter uncle kessler ernsthugo järegård gets a job for him in the zentropa train line as a sleeping car conductor while traveling in the train learning his profession he sees the destructed occupied germany and meets katharina hartmann barbara sukowa the daughter of the former powerful entrepreneur of transport business and owner of zentropa max hartmann jørgen reenberg leopold stays neutral between the allied forces and the germans and becomes aware that there is a terrorist group called werewolves killing the sympathizers of the allied and conducting subversive actions against the allied forces he falls in love for katharina and sooner she discloses that she was a werewolf when max commits suicide leopold is also pressed by the werewolves and need to take a position and a decisionbr br europa is an impressive and anguishing kafkanian story of the great danish director lars von trier using an expressionist style that recalls fritz lang and alternating a magnificent black  white cinematography with some colored details this movie discloses a difficult period of germany and some of the problems this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war very impressive the action of the occupation forces destroying resources that could permit a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country and the corruption with the jew that should identify max jeanmarc barr has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody the hypnotic narration of max von sydow is another touch of class in this awarded film my vote is ninebr br title brazil europa
this is the fifth von trier film i have seen i believe that he is the only director to whom i have given such a high score on all his movies four of them the element of crime europa breaking the waves and dancer in the dark i have given a 10 and one the idiots i have given a 9 and i have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since i first saw it although id like to see it once more before i do he has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors i tend to agree with him i cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films in 50 years when von trier retires he will be looked upon as the preeminent film artist from europe perhaps from the planet and there will be classes taught in his name he simply is the bergman or fellini of our time it is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice thisbr br about europa itself ill admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong i think thats the point this film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare or the subconscious at some level this is absolutely clear from the framing of the film max von sydows narration we are hypnotized or von trier is hypnotized and this is ourhis subconscious mind im inclined to lean more towards his mind since the degradation of europe concerns me an american very little this framing is also clear if you have seen the element of crime an even more brilliant film than this although i am disputing that in my mind what europa needs more than anything is a proper release on dvd hopefully criterion again with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture then i am fairly sure this film would seem as great as any of von triers other films in the element of crime the film begins with a hypnotist whom we actually see on screen this time is hypnotizing fisher a european detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish the first words of that film are fantasy is okay but my job is to keep you on track and whenever fisher the narrator gets off track the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story he even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line something along the lines of do you understand the difference between good and evil the hypnotist laughs and says now fisher she didnt really say that did shebr br so the key to interpreting europa almost a sequel of sorts to the element of crime is that we are deep in ourvon triers subconscious and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone what does the train itself symbolize consider it internally and only then discuss it externally europa is a great film a masterpiece i was never bored by it even though i watched it at 3 am the perfect time to watch actually since it works in dream logic
storyline max von sydows voiceover narration hypnotizes the protagonist and audience back to 1945 where our protagonist the young american ideologist leopold kessler jeanmarc barr has just arrived in postwwii 1945 germany to help rebuilding the damaged country uncle kessler ernsthugo järegård supplies leopold with a job in the big zentropa train corporation but soon leopold falls in love with katharina hartmann barbara sukowa daughter of zentropa owner max hartmann jørgen reenberg leopold soon finds himself caught in a web of corruption being taken advantage of losing his ideology and is forced to chose between pest or colerabr br mysterious mesmerizing manipulative noirish haunting beautiful and ugly these are some immediate grandiose descriptions that come to mind when thinking of lars von triers 1991 masterpiece europa the final chapter of the europa trilogy in usa it was retitled zentropa so audiences wouldnt confuse it with agnieszka hollands europa europa from 1990 equally a wwii drama the europa trilogy also consists of forbrydelsens element from 1984 and epidemic from 1987 the infamous experiment that only sold 900 tickets in the danish cinemas the trilogy thematically deals with hypnotism and loss of idealism although the themes of this trilogy are not as essential as the visuals in the openingshot of europa we see a locomotive moving towards us while our unidentified narrator literally hypnotizes us on the mental count of ten you will be in europa be there at ten i say ten a metaphor for movies ability to transport us into a subconscious dreamrealitybr br europa utilizes a strange but extremely effective visual style  that famous russian director andrei tarkovsky is triers maininfluence says it all its a blackandwhite movie occasionally intertwined with red in form of blood a red dress etc according to rumors this inspired steven spielberg to use the similar effect in shindlers list from 1993 coincidentially another wwii drama furthermore trier uses socalled dutch angels and reinvents backgroundprojection by adding separately shot cooperating layers upon layers but unlike old hollywood movies that incorporated it for economical reasons trier uses it for artistic reasons these carefully executed strangelooking visual techniques underline that we are in a dreamreality we are hypnotized the universe of europa is not real europa is often criticized for weighing advanced technique such as multilayered backgroundprojection above plot and characters but hey thats what reviewers criticized stanley kubricks 1968 visual masterpiece 2001 a space odyssey for  nowadays it holds an obligatory place in all cinemahistory booksbr br europa also gets accused of historical incorrectness apparently trier assigns the nazis werewolf terroristgroup too much historical significance according to various onlinesources thats correct a fascinating subject  try googling it yourself yet triers purposes are neither educational nor portraying history accurately europa is a neverending nightmare leopold kessler is hypnotized therefore the universe that the audience encounters is a distorted reality equally it shows how our memory deceives us  a 100 accurate reconstruction is a lie although young audiences who experience europa are too young to have memories from wwii we have a collective memory of it from various bbc documentaries so these small inaccuracies actually serve a purpose they inform us us that we are not in postwwii germany 1945 but in leopolds memory of itbr br all three europa trilogy chapters portray young ideologists with noble intentions forced into corruption and losing their ideological innocence the ambiguous endings of forbrydelsens element and europa show the ideologists getting forever caught in their hypnotized realities before during and after shooting europa in 1990 in poland lars von trier and cowriter niels vørsel were extremely interested in wwii it shows its packed with extremely beautiful shots catching the atmosphere of the timeperiod spoton a great example is the old polish church europa was shot in poland primarily for economic reasons in the last act of europa as with 2001 space odyssey i think europa will receive its rightfully deserved place in cinemahistory its method of twisting old filmnoir loveaffair clichés and visual techniques is so unique strange and completely different from anything you will see from hollywood nowadays or any other dreamfactory for that matterbr br europa is an essential movie in the lars von trier catalog some write it off as pure commercial speculation but that would be catastrophic its right up there with other trier classics and semiclassics such as forbrydelsens element from 1984 the tvseries riget from 1993 and dogville from 2003 its a unique experience from before trier cared for his actors and before the dogme95 manifesto watch it on the count of ten 910
a few years ago a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the michael mann film heat on it after we finished that movie and were about to stand up we saw that there is another film just after tough on the cassettes envelope the owner didnt write it up yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening which lacked creditsbr br some two hours later i just sat there wondering how could i not have heard of this masterpiece beforebr br this film was europa lars von trier woke film noir from the dead deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets yet often there was haunting similarity with postwar german photographs i saw and then the tricky cutsbr br the story itself is a hardtotake moral odyssey that has no happy end a young american pacifist of german descent comes to postwar germany intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his countrymen dropped but he mostly meets distrust and selfdestructive defiance he hires with zentropa a diningandsleepingcar company modeled on mitropa whose owner is one of the nazi collaborators the occupiers whitewash our hero falls in love with his daughter  who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf nazi postwar terrorists when he doesnt understand the world or just europeans anymore in his rage he blows up a railroad bridge under a train which he just savedbr br as a final note for historical correctness in the real world the werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies they were mostly a final nazi propaganda coup after an ss unit assassinated the major of alliedoccupied aachen two months before the capitulation the nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines the werewolf but only a few hundred of mostly hitler youth received some training and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists or forcedlabourer foreigners in bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants with hitlers death and the wars end it all fell apartbr br however the werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers they feared the werewolf everywhere suspected it behind any serious accident  but without exception another cause was found later ignored by some recent pseudohistorians for example when a gas main exploded in the police hq of bombedout bremen or when the soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in berlin the effect was strongest on the soviets who arrested tens of thousands in large part children preemptively on suspicion of being werewolf and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died
someone release this movie on dvd so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the socalled films of the 1990s and see how vapid they were for the most part and how lars von trier tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece as it stands zentropa or europa as it is referred to outside the us is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the bleakness and almost psychotic uncertainty that oozed out of post wwii europe namely the decimated german landscape whose physical horrors were matched only by the damage to the psyche of its people von trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen you will feel like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940s with the perfectly lighted black and white scenes while at the same time feel you are on the brink of something beyond the cutting edge especially in scenes like the assassination aboard the train literally when you see this movie you are witnessing the evolution of an art form br br for some reason von trier got caught up in his own dogma movement shortly after this and while his breaking the waves and dancer in the dark are classics in their own right it is with zentropa that he truly lifted the art of film making to new and exciting heights 1010 ages like a fine wine and begs for a dvd release
it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series from one to seven and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i didnt see and i what to see it so badly like part two it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans which is cool and showed the return of the puppet master from part one it also showed little aliens from part 4 that was also cool it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it didso thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit
this movie is a great way for the series to finally end peter the boy from puppet master iii is all grown up and is now the puppet master well this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn toulons secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii puppet master iii puppet master 4 puppet master 5 curse of the puppet master and retro puppet master sorry but i guess paramount wouldnt let them use scenes from 1 personally i wish puppet master vs demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say this is the final movie in the series
after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie i was doubtful of giving it a go but i had £399 in my wallet  thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie  saw this and gave it ago  im glad i did i enjoyed it directed by the star of films such as chain reaction the ring bourne identitybrian cox i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it werent at all i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spiderman 2 the character doc ock he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthews name and that made me get it and no his part isnt big at all its very short at the very end of the film its not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film i suggest you give it a go some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing the acting and a bit more action but its watchable
i dont understand why the other comments focus on mcconaughey he has never been a very interesting film actor br br the best part of this movie is the writing and the wit alfred molina and patrick mcgaw make an unusual comic duo definitely not stock types although one cant say their characters are well developed that doesnt make them any less funnybr br the version i saw was on hdnet and had subtitles for the spanish dialog so that was certainly not a problem the use of spanish gives it more authenticity br br a very underrated movie judging by the unusually low score imdb members have given it i thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least a lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting
first of all riget is wonderful good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time nice combination of strange dogma style of telling the story together with good music and great actors but unfortunately theres no the end as for me its unacceptable i was thinking how it will be possible to continue the story without helmer and drusse and i have some idea i think lars should make riget iii a little bit different im sure that 3rd part without helmer wouldnt be the same so heres my suggestion mayble little bit stupid maybe not i know that lars likes to experiment so why not to make small experiment with riget3 i think the only solution here is to create puppetdriven animation like for example team america by trey parker or even computer 3d animation i know its not the same as real actors but in principle i believe it could work only this way its possible to make actors alive again for riget fans this shouldnt be so big difference  if the animation will be done in good way average watcher will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie the most important thing now is the story its completely understandable that its not possible to create riget 3 with the actors nowadays so why not to play with animation and look for the possibilities that it gives to you even marketing one great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation just dreamsbr br i hope to see riget 3 someday or even to see just the script im curious how the story ends and as i expect everybody here dobr br greets slajbr br ps im not talking about the kingdom hospital by stephen king 
the production quality cast premise authentic new england waterbury ct locale and lush john williams score should have resulted in a 34 star collectors item unfortunately all we got was a passable 2 star decent flick mostly memorable for what it tried to dobring an art house style film mainstream the small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself and if well done will satisfy most grownups jane fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable i wondered why she wasnt doing a post doctorate at yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in waterbury robert diniros character was just a bit too contrived an illiterate nice guy loser who turns out to actually be with a little help from janes character a 1990 version of henry ford or thomas edisonbr br this genre has been more successfully handled by nobodys fool in the mid 90s and this years 2003 about schmidt i wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those effortsbr br ill give it an a for effort
normally i dont like series at all theyre all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fastbr br these series however are well played the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one the story will still be catching your mindbr br the episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital
more eeriness and dark secrets released in the final parts of lars von triers fantastic horror satire the kingdom much more is revealed and the ending just leaves you begging for more plus a great performance from udo kier in a more substantial role
second part actually episode 48 of the hit danish tvseries is slightly inferior to the first one but has plenty of laughs and scares as well this time udo kier plays two parts as the monster baby and his demonlike father other standout parts this time are søren pilmark´s doctor krogshoj who must face the horrible revenge of dr helmer and once again patient mrs drusse tries to solve the mysteries miss marplestyle ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors ernst hugo järegård dr helmer and kirsten rolffes mrs drusse you wonder how they´re ever going to be able making part iii but i hope von trier will give it a shot sadly morten rotne leffers the down´s syndrome dishwasher 2 died shortly after as well look for stellan skarsgård in a cameo 
riget ii is a good sequel but not quite as good as the first one this series dont seem to be quite as serious as the first one there are much more comedy in this good one thoughbr br were back at the danish rigshospitalet the danish national hospital mrs drusse is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done but fate wants it otherwise she is soon chasing ghosts and helmer is doing everyone mad and its soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the kingdombr br this story involves a lot more comedy that the previous by all means lot of fun but it makes you take the series a little less serious the story has kept a lot of elements from the last series and added some new ones its well written but some of the new elements are just kind of silly but they save it by making it more like a comedy good story but not as good original and thrilling as the first seriesbr br the actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast they are all very good its an odd story and setting some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not an easy job yet these actors handle this whole situation perfectlybr br much of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact the cinematography is one of those qualities the handheld camera that made trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series it gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and trier makes use of these abilities good movement great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watchbr br be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first also be prepared to see some more i didnt think that green thing looked all too good thought it was unoriginal and didnt fit never the less the effects like the ghosts are really good the nondigital effects looks good too little brother looks just really odd but you accept it all over id say effects are from ok to goodbr br the music is also quite good moody and nice some of it are really touching it fits really nice as the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very wellbr br all together this makes a good sequel if youd seen riget you can see this one without being disappointed it has many of the same qualities as the first series however i would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this these two makes up a series you dont wanna miss
wow 5 more hours of riget lars continues the great combination of occult dark horror and soapopera drama picking up exactly where the last episode of the previous series left offcomplete with the same high intensity and suspense though that doesnt last for better or worse this installation in the franchise seems somewhat more bent on haste in the last series there seemed to pass a day or a week between each episode whereas in this it clearly is one long stretch where one episode ends the next begins a lot can be said about lars von trier but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric both qualities show in this the plot continues its excellence now giving a few regular characters that were minor players in the previous four episodes more attention basically every character from the first returns at least as far as the main roles go the pacing isnt as sharp as in the first part and i found myself less gripped by this one that is not in any kind of way to say that this didnt involve me though i still found myself constantly watching and at several points reacting strongly often out loud to what was going onextremely unusual behavior for me as i am an incredibly silent person as i also was during the first like the first this also brings up some loaded ethical questions building on the foundation from the first this brings the story further and being a sequel the scope is also bigger grander more spirits more bizarre occurrences more subplots the strong graphic material of the first also returns and its been kicked up a notch the characters are developed further the acting is amazing as that of the first udo kier solidifies his immense talent to anyone who doubted it playing a very difficult characteranyone who has seen the first series can most likely figure out what i mean and acting in a language he didnt speakhe was later dubbed and still handing in such a strong performance the cinematography remains great and is still very handheld with rapid zooms and the occasional long take the editing is sharp with a few direct cuts in soundthough these were more prominent in the first now with all that said i would really like to be able to rate this a perfect 10 or at least just under like the first four episodes i truly enjoyed watching and i dont regret it in the least but this does have shortcomings the ones the first part had and more as the first the humor just takes up too much space and this time around its even worse there are several new regular characters that are there for no other reason than to provide comic relief three of them no less scenes are set up and executed for no other reason than to make the audience laugh fine for a comedy but what is it doing in such a dark and unpleasant yes nothing short of sadistic at times horror piece helmers solitary secret hiding place of solitude is changed from the hospital roof from which he could see his beloved sweden to a bathroom with an angle from inside the bowl no you read that right in general the humor seems more lowbrow more sex and bodily function jokes which again begs the question why whilst most of the writing is excellent some of it is downright dire several scenes are basically copied from the first miniseriesone would guess due to their popularity when it aired at times the drama seems a bit more bombastic than that of the first and it jumps too much at times fortunately seldom but still noticeably plot points and items are explained away too easilya certain character living in denmark for no apparent reason for example anyone whos seen it knows who im speaking of the two dishwashers while still mysterious and insightful become too much of a gimmick too overexposed in the end i guess most of the scenes with them are still enjoyable though in addition to that i want to reassure any reader of this that in spite of all the negative things i have just written that this is still mostly good definitely enjoyable compelling powerful and in my humble opinion it should definitely be seen by anyone who liked the firstthough if belong in that group do not expect to feel that the story is finished after watching this any more than you did after the first i recommend this to any fan of lars von trier and anyone who enjoyed the first riget and wants more where that came from i urge anyone whos even considering watching this to make sure youve seen all of the first before you do i bought this before i bought the first but i held out on watching until i had bought the first and watched that and i cant tell you how glad i am that i did though this features a brief summary of the events in the first there are an immense amount of details and aspects that you would miss out on if you didnt see it before watching this slightly lesser sequel but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first 810
sequel to the kingdom is bloodier and even more twisted i only saw half i was exhausted and couldnt sit through all 5 12 hours but i loved what i saw ghosts blood murder poisoning mutated babies voodoothis has it all if you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for youbr br also you dont have to see part 1 to understand thisyoull figure it outbr br does anyone know if kingdom 1 and 2 are available on dvd sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring br br sadly there probably wont be a kingdom 3ernsthugo jaregard sig died a year after this was filmed but you never know
i reached the end of this and i was almost shouting no no no no it cannot end here there are too many unanswered questions the engagement of the dishwashers monas disappearance helmers comeuppance the zombie was little brother saved by his father and what about the head argh then i read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and i have to say i know it probably wouldnt be true to lars von triers vision but i would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned granted it would be hard to find someone to play helmer as the character deserves helmer the doctor you love to hate i think i have yet to see a more selfabsorbed oblivious selfrighteous character on screen but i could overlook a change in actorsi just have to know how it ends
the stories in this video are very entertaining and it definately is worth a look the first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks with a great but unexplained twist at the endbr br the seond is the best of the lot and it alone makes this worth watching  a man is attacked by a dog which he fears to be rabid  he finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be great twist at the end and this episode alone scores 1010 if the others were up to par with this one this would get 1010br br the third is the weakest of the bunch  a girl meets with some guys and has wild sex there appears to be no point to the story until the end with a good little twist but it is spoiled by the awful first partbr br never the less this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all well worth a rental
like his earlier film in a glass cage agustí villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see the heightened drama intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical yet never steps into it in that way it pulls off an almost impossible feat to be so overthetop and yet so painfully restrained to be so charged and yet so understated and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye unabashed gorgeous and highly tense this film is simply superb
if you want to learn something about the spanish civil war and about all the political details and intrigues let me tell you youve chosen the wrong filmbr br this is a vision of the war as it happened in majorca a small island off the coast of spain when a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the traitor almost at once there is no war in the open the soldiers are sent to the front to fight in the mainland while another kind of war happens at home on the small island there neighbours tell on other neighbours sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime but many people are told on because of old family fights or maybe the silent introvert who has no friends is told on by someone who wants to earn some points and these things dont happen in the open there were some trials true but many other times people would just be woken up in the middle of the night taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed and the next morning the bodies would be found and people would have an idea of what had happened but nobody would dare to speak or to do anything were not talking about soldiers killing someone they had never seen in their life were talking about people killing their neighbours and probably saying hello to their widow the next day and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed were talking about villages with one or two thousand inhabitants where everybody knew everybodybr br i am from that small island and ive heard the stories my grandparents told me and i must say that this film upset me oh yes it did but i also found it remarkably beautiful and moving the initial violence is not something the director or the writer made up thats how things happened during that war a kid knowing that his mates dad is in the fascist squad that killed his dad completely possible all that happened later on possible too tb was real too at that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become people were poor illiterate and worked in small farms after the war there were times of hardshipbr br so you wont find a war story in this film or at least not the kind of war story you expect there are no battlefields no soldiers no political intrigues this is the meanest kind of war which happens when the space is limited just check the size of the island when neighbours fight with their neighbours when members of the same family fight each other and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody youll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage or maybe they dontbr br i must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors who managed to sound really majorcan that was remarkable
this film has a special place in my heart as when i caught it the first time i was teaching adult literacy it rang very true to me and even an outstanding student i had at the time there are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation br br excellent performances by jane fonda and robert deniro that rank with their best work a great turn by a young martha plimpton an inspiring story line and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience
the latest film by the spanish director agusti villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a maleprostitute villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in spain under franco the three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosisbr br the cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow spaniard pedro almodovars work with themes dealing with sexual desire both heterosexual and homosexual an element that is different between the two directors is that villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic gritty realism opposed to almodovars use of surrealism although both styles are similarbr br the piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature i highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing
film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me speechless gorgeously photographed and well acted with dialog that approaches poetry the film involves lust hate murder rape theft and deception it weaves an intense web that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits the story is sweeping it takes the audience from the atrocities of the spanish civil war to the human wreckage left behind roger casamajor and bruno bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen supporting players are excellently cast and lend a real sense of authenticity sets lighting scenery and cinematography are wonderful i absolutely love the photography
i saw el mar yesterday and thought it to be a great movie it starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters ramallo manuel tur and francisca after that we jump about 10 years to an hospital where the 3 friends meet againbr br religion sickness love violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tensionfilled moviebr br i see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story its a violent intense and sad story people are expected to suffer to cry to get hurt to bleed and i think that what the film shows isnt done for pure shockvalue or presented in a distasteful way i know that some people like their films clean even those with violence in it but sometimes a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work this is one of those movies and a great movie it isbr br the only fault i found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some plot details werent 100 clear and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie it all made sense but it wasnt anything of much importance to the overall story so i still give this movie a 9
this film is in short a cinematic masterpiece the film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer the film opens during the spanish civil war as a group of children seek their revenge on another child in fact they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium here we see what life has wrought on each of them one is a reclusive sexually repressed patient another man is a hustler who has become ill the third child a young lady has become a nun and is serving at the sanatorium this film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psychebr br this film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving the acting is excellent and the script is quite well written there is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film this is not a film for thrill seekers but a film for a thoughtful audience
el mar directed by catalonian director agusti villarona and based on the novel by blai bonet offers a glimpse of the spanish history as seen by a balearic author that takes the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country the movie concentrates on three friends and follows them from those early days during the onset of the war in majorca to a few years later as two of those friends meet again when they are at a sanatorium lost in the countrysidebr br we first meet three boys that are playing happily not everything is what it seems the tragic death of one of them points out about the cruelty of the one that commits the evil deed the boys have excluded a young girl about their age from taking part in their gamesbr br when we meet the adult ramallo again he is on his way to a sanatorium he seems to be suffering from tuberculosis to his surprise manuel tur one of his boyhood friends is also being treated and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care it is obvious that tur looks at ramallo in a way that only means he is in love with the tough bully their relationship will have devastating consequencesbr br roger casamajor does a good job with portraying the older ramallo bruno bergonzino makes an impression as tur the vulnerable youth antonia torrens plays sor francisca with conviction angela molina puts an appearance as carmen the wife of the caretaker of the institution simon andreu is perfect as alcantarabr br el mar is a dark film that clearly shows agusti villaronas talents in making the novel come alive for the viewer
el mar is a tough stark utterly brilliant brave work of cinematic art director agustí villaronga with an adaptation by antoni aloy and biel mesquida of blai bonets novel has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives and though the focus is on wars heinous tattoo on children the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear this film becomes one of the finest antiwar documents without resorting to pamphleteering the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following childrens march toward adulthoodbr br a small group of children are shown in the spanish civil war of spain threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens ramala nilo mur tur david lozano julia sergi moreno and francisca victoria verger witness the terror of the assassination of men and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide these wideeyed children become adults carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their mindsbr br we then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium ramala roger casamajor has survived as a male prostitute protected by his john morell juli mira and has kept his life style private tur bruno bergonzini has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to catholicism and the blur of delusional selfmutilationcrucifixion francisca antònia torrens has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium the three are rejoined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war tur longs for ramalas love ramala longs to be free from his morell and francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nuns habitbr br the setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death between lust and love and between devotion and destruction is played out to detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable for this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and director villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense the actors both as children and as adults are splendid roger cassamoor bruno bergonzini and antònia torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles the cinematography by jaime peracaula and the haunting musical score by javier navarrete serve the directors vision a tough film this but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath in spanish with english subtitlesbr br grady harp
gespenster question of to be cool in the german cinemabr br there are not many german films in the last ten years who have made me so interest yes the problem of the most german films are in this film gespenster too he is on some places to uncooked to be good to see special the figure of toni sabine timento is too cool but thats is in german films always so everybody must to learns this coolneß  is the realism in this films thats difficult to understand but in this case it makes some sense because she steals and she lies  she is the kind of girl is better you never love it because you lose it thats not clear for the other girl nina in this film she love her  and she would lose her but nina lost everything she will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling there is no way  but you must take it said herbert achterbusch for twenty years thats so often the way it goes in german films why nina julia hummer is not inside of the laws of society  the is outside  and there she have no chance this films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside thats one of the problems  the stupid break with conventions  the criminal fascination throw it all away  and go nowhere but the actress plays this difficult part very interesting on the other side  there the parents  who are the pendant to the two girls the have a car  a hotel suite  the have money and live in world with music of the opera but the film stand always in some distance to seem there is no much explaining of thembr br in the center of this film there is one scene you will never forget the two girls got to a casting and there they should say how they find together in this scene toni will lying on she said a fantastic storyhas nothing to do with her and then nina will say the truth she said it in an introversion way there is no exhibition in it she looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here thats a great moment in the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on than toni goes awaybr br okay the film will end  in the german way of coolneß  rubbish  here the circle of sadness is closing but there was a moment  where is happening something else  and this moment was important he is more than german coolneß  and this moments are rare in the german cinema in this time
gespenster 2005 forms together with yella 2007 and jerichow 2008 the gespenstertrilogy of director christian petzold doubtless one of the cremedelacreme german movie directors of our timebr br roughly gespenster tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in berlin  and has never been seen ever since then the mother keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches by aid of timedilated photography for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age as we hear later in the movie the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter marie however this time when she meets nina everything comes quite differentbr br the movie does not bring solutions not even partsolutions and insofar it is rather disappointing we are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not if her actual daughter is still alive or not most disappointing is the end after what we have witnessed in the movie it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves nina alone the simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed can be a strong effect of dramaturgy fex in umberto d but in gespenster it is displacedbr br since critics have been suggesting freudian motives in this movie let me give my own attempt why is it that similar persons do not know one another especially not the persons that another similar person knows this is quite an insane question agreed from the standpoint of aristotelian logic according to which the notion of the individual holds the individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else so the aristotelian answer to my question is they do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change everybody who is not insane believes that however what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change eg scarfs on their left under ankle or a heartshaped birthmark under their right shoulderblade this is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made although i am not sure whether even the director has realized that despite our modern aristotelian world the superstition conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality and that individuality therefore is not something erratic but rather diffusional so that the borders between persons are open such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrationalism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking  a source of gespenster of the most interesting kind
ive seen this film more than once now and theres always someone complaining about the obvious construction of the plot afterwards but then  this is part of petzolds game he plays along with the rules of genrebr br its very nice how the highly improbable story of how the two girls timoteohummer meet is again mirrored in another even more improbable story that the girls make up for a casting this film is a journey between fact and fiction its more about potentials things that might have happened in the past or might be happening in the future than it is about actual ongoings its a reverie sorts of  so apt enough there are a lot of motives freud might have found interesting for his dream analysis like all the doppelgangerconstellations br br also i think gespenster might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current asian cinema of the uncanny petzolds everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unobtrusive strangely familiar way this film is not about the obvious to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers or as the story of an orphaned mother who searches europe for her lost daughter clearly doesnt say much about the nature of gespenster at all
this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival but unlike yes by sally potter which i had seen some days before where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive this time quite the opposite thing happened there was something that dragged me down and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe it was as if all of a sudden there was nothing left all hope all future had been taken away to a dead placebr br ninas life seemed to be dismal and locked but then one lovely day there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion just out of nothing someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life that person was toni a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots just like herselfbr br but the films title is ghosts and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish there is no way to retain them
i guess if a film has magic i dont need it to be fluid or seamless it can skip background information go too fast in some places too slow in others etc magic in this film the scene in the library there are many minor flaws in stanley  iris yet they dont detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible the hardest to fix both characters are smart yet stanley cant understand enough to function because he cant read he cant read because hes had too much adventure in his childhood iris although welleducated hasnt had enough adventure and so cant understand how to move past the uturn her life took in both their faults and strengths the characters compliment each other it may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an iris would wind up working year after year in a factory or that a stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other betterpaying job and while these mysteries are explained in the course of the story their unfolding seems somewhat contrived i assume no one took the time to rethink the script even so its a good moviejust imagine what de niro fonda and plimpton would have done on screen if someone had
a funny comedy from beginning to end there are several hilarious scenes but its also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me creative story line with a very talented cast i thoroughly enjoyed it
this silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences its heros are a couple of dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them down some very silly roads chasing the big murder case you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime no nudity but lots of sexual implication slapstick sillinesseverything adolescents go for low budget but very entertaining definite cult classic potential
for a no budget movie this thing rocks i dont know if americas gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through some really funny funny stuff really nonhollywoodbr br the actors and music rocked the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up whooo whooobr br ive seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them i think ive seen in commercials or in something somewhere basically it rocked luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors
firsttime director tom kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting dark comedy shot on a shoestring budget yet had the flavor of the early coen brothers film blood simple  and throw in some monty python flavorings to boot needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next expect more good things to come from this writerdirectoractor
dont say i didnt warn you but your gonna laugh probably enough to hurt your stomach sure its got some blood splattering all in good fun though so its got no budget who needs a budget when you got a script like this br br take the time and check this out well worth a two hour viewing if everyone could laugh as much as i did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to livebr br 
one of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private yacht decide to take an impromptu swim  in their underwear rather risqué for 1931
this was the first movie that joan crawford and clark gable made together and they would go on to make several more crawford stars a young rich girl whos father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother they have never worked before and the brother william bakewell gets a job with gable who is a gangster and bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on their is a massacre in which several of gables men are killed and crawford was a witness to the whole thing its a good movie but not one of their best
dance fools dance is an early crawfordgable vehicle from 1931 crawford plays a bonnie jordan a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties booze and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming this all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother william blakewell penniless bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name mary smith her brother goes to work for bootleggers the head man is jake luva  portrayed by clark gable as he plays yet another crook later of course he would turn into a romantic hero but in the early 30s mgm used him as a bad guy not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity bonnie cozies up to luvabr br gable and crawford made a great team her facial expressions are a little on the wild side but that along with her dancing is one of the things that makes the movie fun look for cliff edwards the voice of jiminy cricket as bertbr br its always interesting to see the precode movies and dance fools dance is no exception
this is one of joan crawfords best talkies it was the first gablecrawford pairing and made it evident to mgm and to audiences that they were a sizzling team leading the studio to make seven more films with them as costarsbr br the film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister who after their father loses everything in the stock market crash must fend for themselves and work for a living life is hard in the depression and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile and they resort to underworld activity br br joan crawford is excellent as the socialiteturnedmoll shes smart complex and believable she even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actors early talkie acting style clark gable is a diamondinthe rough masculine and gruff as the nononsense gangster who becomes involved with crawfords character the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite norma shearer in a free soul securing his position as top male sex symbol at mgmbr br if you like crawford in this type of role dont miss paid which she did a year earlier which is also among her best early talkie performancesbr br 
joan crawford had just begun her working girl makes good phase with the dynamic paid 1930 she had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed so while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering because they were clinging to characters that had been the in thing a few years before but were now becoming passe joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress the depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon of course if you became rich through immoral means but suffered for it  that was alrightbr br this film starts out with a spectacular house boat party bonnie jordan joan crawford is the most popular girl there  especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear however when bonnies father has a heart attack because of loses on the stock market both bonnie and her brother rodney william bakewell realise who their real friends are after bob townsend lester vail  a poor mans johnny mack brown offers to do the right thing and marry her  they had just spent a night together when bonnie declared with abandon that she wants love on approval  she starts to show some character by deciding to get a jobbr br she finds a job at a newspaper and quickly impresses by her will to do well her working buddy is bert scranton cliff edwards and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job she is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer jake luva clark gable rodney witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces spilling the beans to the first person he sees drinking at the bar  which happens to be bert he is then forced to kill bert and after wards he goes into hiding the paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find berts killer and sends bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of jakes clubs joan does a very lively dance to accordian joe  much to sylvies disgust the film ends with a gun battle and as rodney lies dying bonnie tearfully phones in her storybr br this is a super film with crawford and gable giving it their all natalie moorehead who as sylvie shared a famous cigarette scene with gable early in the film was a stylish other woman who had her vogue in the early thirties william bakewell had a huge career he had started as a teenager in a douglas fairbanks film in the mid 20s a lot of his roles though were weak spineless characters in this film he played the weak brother and was completely overshadowed by joan crawford and the dynamic newcomer clark gable  maybe that was why he never became a starbr br highly recommended
i found this to be a soso romancedrama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it its not a hallmark hall of fametype family film with sleepingbeforemarriage considered normal behavior but considering it stars jane fonda and robert de niro i would have expected a lot rougher movie at least languagewise br br the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult thats the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but to be honest the film isnt that memorablebr br its still a fairly mild nice tale that i would be happy to recommend
dont listen to fuddyduddy critics on this one this is a gem young rich joan and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies  and now they have to work for a living she naturally becomes a reporter and he just as naturally a driver for the mob by wild coincidences their careers meet head on thanks to gangster clark gable in the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for joan to do a couple of risque dance numbers with all the grace of a steamshovelbr br but none of this is supposed to be taken seriously  its all good fun from those wonderful precode days when hollywood was really naughty joan looks great and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity thank god she stopped the dancing gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster  he wasnt a star yet and so didnt have to be the hero great to see him playing something different and william bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother and there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director harry beaumont who moves the piece on with a cracking pace  and an occasional wink to the audience great fun
i disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as just entertainment set right after the carefree roaring 20s during the early days of the great depression dance fools dance is at its heart an earnest cautionary tale with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times yet this fastpaced and tightlyplotted film is far from being a dreary morality talebr br in the 30s hollywood had a knack for churning out one entertaining and enlightening audiencepleaser after another all without wasting a frame of film dance fools dance  one of four films that harry beaumont directed in 1931  is barely 80 minutes long yet its characters are well developed its story never seems rushed and despite its many twists in plot the audience is never left behindbr br with the lone exception of lester vail as flaccid love interest bob townsend the supporting cast is uniformly strong worthy of note are william bakewell as crawfords brother cliff edwards best known as the voice of jiminy cricket as reporter bert scranton and clark gable in an early supporting role as gangster jake luvabr br but this is joan crawfords film and she absolutely shines in it made when she was just 27 this lesserknown version of crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work however here is proof that long before she took home an oscar for mildred pierce crawford was a star in the true sense of the word a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herselfbr br score eight out of ten
i saw this movie on comedy central a few times this movie was pretty good its an interesting adventure with the life of sunny davis who is arranged to marry the king of ohtar so that the us can get an army base there to balance power in the middle east some good jokes including sunnygate i also just loved the ending theme it gave me great political spirit ten out of ten was my rating for this movie
actually goldie hawn is from washington takoma park maryland but i digress this is sort of a mr smith goes to washington type of movie with some variations but the same premise i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn the story is interesting but its highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shots life it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous i had to laugh possible spoiler ahead it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up and the speech she made at the endbeautiful too bad not many people have guts like that in real life
sunny a cocktail waitress in the dc area is a bit dim to put in mildly she drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple however she saves the life of a prominent arab by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official she charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks sniffing an opportunity presidential aides get her installed in the protocol department for the us government even then she messes things up at times but she tries hard and learns a lot she even grabs the romantic attention of a state department official but is there another sinister plot in the making involving an arab man who wishes to take another wife a blonde one lol lol lol this movie features goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb as a fox as they say sunny learns her way around the jungle of the us government very very well she even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings perhaps the arab community would be less than thrilled with this work but for those who like to laugh rent this today
a pretty average movie but a brave one from ms hawn to promote this vehicle as exec producer  as a starring vehicle although she ends up vindicated she is willing to portray herself as the dizzy bimbo how many other a listed actresses have subjected themselves to butt injury pratfalls since this movie not many does this mean the female butt cannot be funny goldie surpasses other actresses as she has maintained a screen persona  ventures in projects other wont sandra bullock occasionally goes therefor example miss congeniality but nicole kidman would never cop the pratfall a wonderful performer great to see some of my favorite actors chris sarandon  cliff deyoung notably
beware spoilers this movie was okay goldie hawn and chris sarandon were the best two in it okay so the goofie foreign guy who spoiler here trades with the biker for his clothes was funny this guys boss was good too but the movie really belonged to sarandon and hawn these two should have had a lot more time on screen together theyre chemistry was great the bathroom scenewow romantic sweet yummybr br hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians to talk about sarandon would be to give a lot away spoilers this is a rather untypical romanticpolitical comedy and it satisfies both somewhatthe political side a whole lot more than the romantic it touches on political issues and just barely skims on romantic areasbr br 
this is a feelgood movie and nothing more and for that it is great fun to watch sure it skims over political issues but so what i am sure she wasnt trying to make good night and good luck here lets not try to make it anything else but what it islight fare br br and very enjoyable at thatbr br do we remember what 1984 was like weve become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not i tend to differ on this point goldie knew this was funfluff and she went ahead and did itbr br like her lightest fare protocol overboard housesitter wildcats private benjamin seems like old times foul play death becomes her first wives club and the remake of outoftowners goldie knows what she is doingshe plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it goldie just knows herself really well and she knows what she can do really wellbr br she has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently i loved her in laughin and every thing shes ever been in she has never tried to be anything else but who she isand thats that bubbling giggly girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and youve just got to lighten up because before you know ityou are old wrinkled and suffering from one of lifes inevitable ailments if it even comes that latebr br i appreciate goldie for what she is a lovable comic actress
protocol is a hitandmiss picture starring goldie hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting arab from an assassination attempt the woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job working for the us government will the corridors of power in our nations capital ever be the same hawn is excellent as usual even though protocol isnt as funny as her best film private benjamin but its still a good movie and i did laugh alotbr br  out of four
the first sidestory in the universal century gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies the focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyesbr br the story does contain some gundam staples its premise being the attempts by a zeon squad to capture an experimental gundam but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch this series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named alfred and the relationship between his neighbor christina mckenzie who is secretly a federation pilot and a newbie zeon pilot named bernie wiseman alfred develops a sort of brotherly love for bernie while our young zeon pilot also falls for christinabr br war in the pocket proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story there are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here this short 6 episode ova focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool he is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war the unlikely friendship and bonding between bernie and christina each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff same goes for the endearing relationship between alfred and bernie that being said i would not want to spoil much of the story here but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending br br despite its lack of action this show never falls into the category of boring the characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an ova and are sure to satisfy the craving for some mandatory mobile suit battles in a gundam seriesbr br normally watching anime in japanese or english i would leave up to personal preference but in this case i strongly recommend the english voice track over the japanese one not only do the characters whom all except alfred are caucasian sound more believable in english but the performances of the english voice cast are on par and even surpass the japanese one instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action tv dramasbr br in short this show does not try to impress the audience what it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child a truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given
this is a complex film that explores the effects of fordist and taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations there are constant references to assembly line production where workers are treated as cogs in a machine overseen by managers wielding clipboards controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed and firing workers stanley who meet all criteria as his supervisor says are always on time are hard workers do good work but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake br br this system destroys families  stanley has to send his father to a nursing home where he quickly dies after stanley loses his job iris daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant references are made to the fact that now with declining wages both partners need to work the implication being that theres nobody left at home to care for the kids iris husband is dead from an illness and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care iris brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift andor teeth job even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them the one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail presumably hes also black and black men suffer disproportionally high incarceration rates she remarks that he like her is doing time  her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slavebr br stanley however still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of fordist capitalism he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his fathers traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy  he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract as iris brother in law does suggesting that he married the wrong sister he does not as iris says conform to the workeatsleep routine of everyone else rather he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way in a sort of bauhaus ideal this was the dream of early modernists and 1920s socialists such as the bauhaus  to use technology to provide for all basic needs allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations he is also outside of traditional gender relations he cooks he cleans he cares for his family and he knows how to iron iris on the other hand lives in a traditionally male role  shes a factory worker the mains source of income for her extended family and she brings stanley into the public realm traditionally offlimits to women by teaching him to read and write she gives him access to the world of knowledge also traditionally gendered malebr br literacy here is used as a metaphor for the traditionally masculine public realm and the systems of circulation monetary vehicular cultural that enable participation in the public realm without this access stanley is feminized  the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning he is excluded from all regular circulations unable to participate in the monetary cant open a bank account in the vehicular cant get a drivers license cant ride the bus and in the social he asks if he exists if he cant write his namebr br after learning to read he grabs books on auto repair farming and spirituality the bible the word of god is therefore relativized placed on the same value plane as howto books in fact organized religion in general is only very occasionally present  the bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find stanley and iris having sex it is however acknowledged as a moral force  iris clearly a character devoted to living a good life mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatchingbr br once able to read he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan a car and a house taking his place at the head of the family the breadwinner presumably hes an industrial designer dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce this ending probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film is so incongruous with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it wasnt forced in by some studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feelgood ending and its potential effect on the bottom linebr br now that according to the pundits weve comfortably moved on to postindustrial capitalism the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period br br nevertheless its highly recommended  at least if you want to exercise your brain disregard the ending and its close to a perfect 10
when gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else this ova is kinda the opposite though therere only half a dozen episodes it isnt filled with action but emotional things the two main action sequences in this i believe are enough to satisfy me after seeing so many gundam series movies and ovas i was completely ready for a civilianesquire movie this movie did a fantastic job of that what makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people it made the zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where theyre depicted as the second rise of evil nazis most people that dont like anime that ive forced to watch this movie lol liked it so id recommend it to a lot of people just for the antiwar story if youre a gundam fan and havent seen this you shouldnt be reading this you should already be watching it right now
uc 0079 the one year war is almost at an end a neutral colony of side 6 has been targeted by cyclops a zeon task force their target a new gundam being built exclusively for newtypes supposedly built for amuro ray from the original gundam saga inside when little boy al izuruha a fan of zeon ms encounters a zaku after battle breaks out in the colony he befriends newbie ms pilot benard bernie wiseman the two become good friends al is treated as an honorary member of the cyclops team through the show bernie acts as a father figure to al whose real father is always working and seems to be taken with federation pilot christina mckenzie but eventually they must meetin battle al soon learns that war is not childs play and bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his missionbr br for only 6 episodes gundam 0080 is a well done show the mobile suits are extremely well designed and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters if you liked 0083 then check this one out or if you are new to the gundam world this is a good show to start with if you look to a show for drama and character development this is the one for you it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle i would rate it more of a drama than actionbr br mobile suit gundam 0080 war in the pocket br br sometimes you have to lose to win
if you are uninitiated to the gundam world this is a good place to start if you are burned out on star wars or star trek here is a compelling realistic scifi series you can become immersed in not the simplistic boysavesworldingiant robot story you might have expected but rather a complex emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the good and bad guys is decidedly less than distinctbr br gundam 0080 focuses on the story of al izuruha a young naive boy living in a neutral space colony he spends his days daydreaming about mobile suits and playing war with his friends during the course of this series al befriends an enemy soldier bernie wiseman by the end little al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrificebr br i loved this oav series with its cool mecha designs involving story and likeable characters i recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic sf anime or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment
exquisite comedy starring marian davies with the affable william haines young peggy arrives in hollywood seeking stardom cameo performances showcase all the stars in mgms heaven in the famous commissary scene plus lots of vintage film making detail for the scholar pic also captures for posterity davies famous wickedly sarcastic impersonations of the top stars of the day her swanson is a beautbr br peggy even catches herself as she encounters the famous star marian davies at tennis turns up her nose and comments ohh i dont like herbr br my print was perfect story direction acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados
there are no people like show people marion davies as peggy pepper and william haines as billy boone my introduction to ms davies was a clip from this film the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions my introduction to mr haines was in viewing this film presently though its possible ive seen him in a less memorable role haines makes an incredible impression when he joins davies for a commissary meal  tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table indeed haines and davies deliver great comic performancesbr br the story starts off with dell henderson colonel pepper driving daughter davies into hollywood certain she will become tinseltowns newest sensation indeed davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars but davies yearns to become a true drama queen davies leaves haines and partners up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli but audiences prefer davies in more comic roles perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life br br full of great hollywood location footage both on the set and off full of great cameos at a studio lunch at the stars table davies sits between douglas fairbanks and william s hart the best bit player however is charlie chaplin who has enough nerve to ask davies for her autograph while the cameos are fun they and the episodic sequences do help show people become less of an important film and more of an important historical document br br  show people 111128 king vidor  marion davies william haines dell henderson
i finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of show people i cannot comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words seeing the cameo outofcharacter appearances of so many mgm silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself i really like the scene where marion davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie patricia pepoire make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees marion davies but it is something to the effect of i dont think i like her pop the corn pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history enjoy
there are some wonderful things about this movie marion davies could act given the right property she is wonderful in comedic roles william haines could act and you can see why he was one of the screens most popular leading men until a potential scandal forced him from the businessbr br the story is a bit trite but handled so beautifully that you dont notice king vidors direction is one of the principle reasons for this the producer the boy genius irving thalbergbr br its about movie making and you get to see the process as it was done in 1928 the cameras sets directors directing and actors emoting you get to see briefly some of the major stars of the day even charlie chaplin does a turn as himself seeking an autograph you also catch glimpses of eleanor boardman elinor glyn claire windsor king vidor and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographsbr br please even if youre not a fan of the silents take the time to catch this film when you can its really a terrific trip back in time
marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy show people released by mgm in 1928 davies plays a hick from savannah georgia who arrives in hollywood with her father dell henderson the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot  as is davies outrageous southern costume davies lands a job in slapstick comedy not what she wants but it brings her success she meets fellow slapstick star william haines who is immediately smitten with her well davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio high art studios and lands a job in stuffy period pieces a handsome but fake actor andre telefair shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life but of course learns that is not who she really is marion davies is wonderful throughout as she  outrageously  runs the gamut of emotions required of a serious actress william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self and there are cameos by charles chaplin john gilbert and other famous stars of the day including the director of the film king vidor this is a silent film with a few sound effects as sound pictures were just coming into their own a treasure of a film
im a huge classic film buff but am just getting in to silent movies a lot of silent films dont hold my attention but show people is a notable exceptionbr br marion davies and william haines are simply wonderful in this picture davies in particular shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriouslybr br show people is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era the movie captured my attention immediately and i actually forgot that it was a silent film i know that doesnt make much sense but thats what happened the actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessarybr br show people is a perfect introduction to silent films it is a fast paced interesting film with two of the silent eras best stars add in the satire of hollywood and show people should be on the must see list for all classic film buffs
1928 is in many ways a lost year in motion pictures just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre sound was coming in and  while reaping great profits at the box office  was setting the art of filmmaking back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technologybr br show people is one of the great silent era comedies the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him learns his lesson and then redeems himself by winning the football game the polo game etc this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane she had excellent comic instincts and timing this film starts out as the beverly hillbillieslike adventure of peggy pepper marion davies and her father general marmaduke oldfish pepper fresh from the old south general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress while at the studio commissary the peppers run into billy boone william haines a slapstick comedian he gets peggy an acting job shes unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick but she perseveres eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles soon the newfound fame goes to her head and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man whom she doesnt really love unless fate somehow intervenesbr br one of the things mgm frequently does in its late silentera films and in its early soundera films is feature shots of how filmmaking was done at mgm circa 1930 this film is one of those as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggys autograph an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesnt care for her truly a delight from start to finish this is a silent that is definitely worth your while this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible
stanley and iris is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life stanleys life is difficult because he never learned to read or write iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets stanley she decides to teach stanley how to read at her home in her spare time over time they become romantically involved after stanley learns to read he goes off to a good job in chicago only to return to iris and ask her to marry himbr br its a really good film without nudity violence or profanity that which is rare in todays films a good film all round br br 
i had seen marion davies in a couple of movies and really couldnt understand her appeal she couldnt dance for peanuts she didnt attempt to sing and as for her acting  she seemed in a trance but i hadnt seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful rather than kidding her own image as has been suggested here to me it seems a satire on gloria swanson who did start off in slapstick comedies went on to highly emotional womens pictures and did end up marrying a count marion a top mimic also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand that was gloria swanson spot onbr br colonel pepper dell henderson has motored all the way from georgia to hollywood determined to prove that his daughter peggy marion davies will be the greatest star ever their hope dwindles and they are down to their last 40 cents when they meet billy boone william haines who works at the slapstick studios and promises to get peggy a job peggy thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic they convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success charlie chaplin asks for her autograph but she doesnt recognise him and treats him pretty rudely who was that short little guy  when she finds out she faints peggy and billy get a call from high art studio but only peggy is wanted and suddenly she is on her way there is a funny scene where she sees a star she doesnt think much of  its marion daviesbr br she finally gets a chance of being a dramatic actress  but she cant cry it is a hilarious scene as the director tries everything to get her to cry and when he succeeds she cant stop her new leading man andre paul ralli convinces her to forget her comedy past and become elite and sophisticated  she even adopts a new name  patricia pepoire she also seems to have forgotten billy and her dad  she has developed a star personality when the slapstick studio picks the same location as patricias movie billy is thrilled to see her but quite unprepared for her snobby attitude when she calls him a cheap clown he realises that she is not the girl he once knew br br after a studio luncheon  a magnificent panning shot of some of the greatest stars of the day patricia gets a call from the boss it seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them  the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old peggy back she and andre decide to get married she dreams of being a countess even though billy says that andre used to serve him spaghetti in a little cafe downtown and is no more a count than he is on her wedding day billy visits and after a hilarious custard pie fight she realises that billy is the one for herbr br it was amazing to see all the guest stars  john gilbert is seen going through the mgm gates lew cody is talking to elinor glynn who not only wrote it but several racy romances that were made into mgm movies william haines another actor whose movies i had always wanted to see was great  especially in the cafeteria scene  he had wonderful comic timing harry gribbon was hilarious as the comedy director  there were so many hilarious scenes in this film and marion was at the top of them all  im giving this film 10 out of 10br br highly highly recommended
back in the day if marion davies had had her druthers and didnt just listen to william randolph hearst shed have done more films like show people and been a lot happier in fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy shed have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like when knighthood was in flower and janice meredith br br what youre seeing by all accounts in show people is the real davies a gifted comedienne a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person she could really identify with the character of peggy pepper aka patricia prepoire she put up with her share of pretense in her hollywood stardombr br if the plot of show people was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story i guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in hollywood like so many others looking for that big break she wants to drama but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics she gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face but learns her trade and also wins the heart of young comic actor william hainesbr br she does get her first big break but it doesnt come for haines as well and marion does get to do legitimate drama with actor paul ralli playing andre telfair a pretend no account count of avignon somebody here was taking a shot at actor lou tellegen lover and husband of sarah bernhardt and geraldine farrar and others and to hear tell of it one of the most despised people in cinemabr br show people was one of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves you will get to see folks like charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart mae murray john gilbert eleanor boardman etc just being themselves in and around the film colony that in itself makes show people a film worth savingbr br show people also made good use of standard tin pan alley songs like aint we got fun im sitting on top of the world youd be surprised california here i come as the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced a song called crossroads was introduced in it its not a bad number but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack i guess since theyre not seen it was felt no billing was necessary still id like to know and im sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see show peoplebr br its easy to see why marion davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite she looks so at home in this film and her real life lack of pretense shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience
prior to seeing show people my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick and slapstick only i could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous pratfalls but this masterful film proved me wrong davies in my view was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to lucille ball i mention lucy primarily because davies mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point that i wonder if davies wasnt one of balls primary influences this is coming from a 21 year old who had never before seen silent comedy and i must say that no matter how much of the periodspecific references you actually get i didnt apparently you will not be bored by this movie you will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies this is not only my favorite silent comedy but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time
sunday july 16 800pm the castro san franciscobr br as a southern colonel your makeup is very indianabr br the yammering gossips of hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in marion davies direction over the years that she had fame handed to her and was undeserving is often speculated considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into this criticism would seem to have some validity as a comedienne however her star shone very brightly left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled mabel normand one of her better outings was king vidors show people 1928 which survives and is so well known largely because mgm filled it with star cameos this happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars davies and that notorious joe college wisecracker william haines rumor has it show people was loosely based on the life of gloria swanson who began in sennett comedies and rose to grand drama and dont think she didnt spend the rest of her life reminding everyone with von stroheim walsh and demille coincidentally the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs keystone had abandoned the year before think of who worked therebr br colonel marmaduke oldfish pepper dell henderson drives his daughter peggy davies from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies these two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible billy boone haines   a custard pie artist 
perhaps the funniest backstage at hollywood movie ever especially for a look at comedy short factories like keystonebr br marion davies should get a medal for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role plenty of cameos for film buffs
show people is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl peggy pepper whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen though shes a success in comedy what she wants to do is make art so she moves up to high arts studio soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billybr br many stars of the silent era have cameos in show people including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup im sure when people saw the film in 1928 they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene sadly nowadays its not the case even for film buffs in one part of the film however she does meet charlie chaplin in another author elinor glyn is pointed out to her and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film other stars who pop up in show people are john gilbert douglas fairbanks william s hart leatrice joy bess flowers renee adoree rod laroque aileen pringle and many othersbr br davies was adorable and a lively comedienne its a shame william haines quit the movies  he was cute and energetic deservedly an enormous star back in the daybr br show people is a simple story told in a witty way its also a look back at an exciting era in hollywoods history and contains performances by two wonderful stars
this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film i believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies style that could be termed zany beauty vidors direction is light but surehanded the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary and the starwatching element for fans of the silent era with many cameos adds to the overall fun it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well for all movie fans who have a kneejerk reaction to watching silent films sit through this one and it may change your attitude br br 
wisecracker the biography of actor william haines offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies the old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a los angeles museum screening of show people the late silent feature in which he costarred with marion davies beforehand haines was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter but he was pleasantly surprised and no doubt relieved at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it watch the film today and you can see why show people is a delightful hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair yet without malice its still funny and its satirical points still resonate needless to say the technology of moviemaking has changed vastly since the silent days but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves havent changed all that muchbr br show people also stands as the best surviving work of marion davies a firstrate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes where her career was concerned davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour the newspaper magnate william randolph hearst its well known that hearst exerted enormous influence over davies choice of roles and well known too that despite her gift for comedy he preferred to see her play dignified heroines in period costume dramas by the late 20s for whatever reason marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies including the red mill and the patsy but show people directed by the great king vidor stands as her most enjoyable showcase william haines gives an engaging likable performance as her boyfriend and costar billy boone but this is the leading ladys show all the waybr br marion plays southern belle peggy pepper an aspiring actress who storms hollywood accompanied by her father determined to become a movie star her dad colonel pepper is played by actordirector dell henderson a veteran of griffiths biograph dramas whocoincidentallyresembled hearst one of marions funniest bits often excerpted elsewhere is her audition at the comet studio casting office while dad helpfully suggests emotions to portray sorrow    joy and drops a handkerchief across her face peggy assumes the appropriate expression and posture shes hired only to discover that comet makes lowbrow comedies the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue of course comet is intended as a takeoff of mack sennetts keystone but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds as peggy pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves comet for the more prestigious high art studio assuming the name patricia peppoire as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress at some point it may occur to us as it surely did to viewers in 1928 that davies rival gloria swanson started out in keystone comedies before rising to prominence in serious dramas for cecil b demille and as miss peppoire takes herself more and more seriously giving the highhat treatment to former colleagues such as lowly comic billy boone davies performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed squarely at swanson herself this is especially notable during an interview sequence when miss peppoires spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spoton impersonation of swanson i suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof but i have to wonder how friendly relations were between gloria and marion after this movie was releasedbr br in any event show people is a delicious treat for buffs who will relish the parade of star cameos throughout charlie chaplin contributes a nice bit sans makeup and looking quite distinguished eagerly seeking patricia peppoires autograph and in a show of good sportsmanship marion davies herself puts in a selfmocking cameo appearance evening the score for poking fun at swanson by poking fun at herself this is a silent film that viewers not especially attuned to silents might appreciate at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business show people surely belongs in the company of such classics as sunset boulevard and singin in the rain among hollywoods most expertly produced enjoyable exercises in amused selfexamination
oh its so cool to watch a silent classic once in while director vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy at least for 1928 cameo as himself the story is about having success in life and the way it changes you marion davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger drama studio she becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world for a moment she even denies her poor past the cameos are simply hilarious certainly the scene where the main character marion davies seesmarion davies in the studios and concludes she doesnt seem that special its got to be one of the first movieinthemovies here and for real freaks its awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then a mustsee if you ask me
ive seen hundreds of silent movies some will always be classics such as nosferatu metropolis the general and wings but among them my favorite is this film it may not be the bestbut a favorite yes in fact when i looked it up on imdb i noticed i immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so goshdarn cute and wellmade marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not just william randolph hearsts mistressbr br the story involves a hick from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a mustsee
i just read the comments of tomreynolds2004 and feel i have to jump in here i understand he doesnt like the film but his reasons are not evident my feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness failure disappointment and sorrow each of these two people as portrayed have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire sentimental and sappy i really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances i have every reason to dislike jane fonda for her vietnam era actions but personal feelings apart she is fabulous in this role robert deniro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities this is the first i have seen deniro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and i really like it this film was a big surprise when i first viewed it and i look forward to seeing it again
if you like adult comedy cartoons like south park then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at bromwell high keisha natella and latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches i think keisha is a good leader there are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school theres the idiotic principal mr bip the nervous maths teacher and many others the cast is also fantastic lenny henrys gina yashere eastenders chrissie watts tracyann oberman smack the ponys doon mackichan dead ringers mark perry and blunders nina conti i didnt know this came from canada but it is very good very good
updated from a previous comment the great and underrated marion davies shows her comedic stuff in this late 1928 silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines a bit player in crude comedies they appear together in cheap comedies until marion is discovered and becomes a big dramatic starbr br a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretensions davies  haines are a wonderful team and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart john gilbert elinor glyn norma talmadge mae murray rod larocque leatrice joy dorothy sebastian estelle taylor louella parsons renee adoree aileen pringle and marion davies you have to see it are a hoot a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the stillmaligned marion davies dell henderson plays the father polly moran is a maid paul ralli is the slimy leading manbr br show people was said to have used the career of gloria swanson as its model i think mae murray is closer davies and swanson were friends but this films story does parallel the rise of swanson from onereel mack sennett comedies with charlie chaplin to star in cecil b demille films of the late teens and early 20sbr br davies and haines were huge mgm stars and friends odd that mgm never teamed them up in a talkie theyre great together a sweet romance and delightful spoof of early hollywood greta garbo and bebe daniels are mentioned but do not appear
the great and underrated marion davies shows her stuff in this late 1928 silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines they appear in cheap comedies until marion is discovered and becomes a big dramatic star a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretentions davies  haines are a wonderful team too bad they never made a talkie together and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart john gilbert elinor glynn and marion davies you have to see it are a hoot a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the stillmaligned marion davies
a give this movie a 1010 because it deserves a 1010 two of the best actors of their timewalter matthau  george burns collaborate with neil simon and all of the other actors that are in this film  director herbert ross and all of that makes this stage adaption come true the sunshine boys is one of the best films of the 70s i love the type of humor in this film it just makes me laugh so hardbr br i got this movie on vhs 3 days ago yes vhs because it was cheaperonly 3 i watched it as soon as i got home but i had to watch it again because i kept missing a few parts the first time the second time i watched it it felt a lot better and i laughed a lot harder im definitely going to reget this on dvd because i have to see the special featuresbr br its very funny how that happens two people work together as entertainersactorsperformers they get along well on stage but really argue off stage they cant survive another minute with each other then some 15 years later you want to reunite them for a tv special you can find that in this film matthau  burns were terrific in this film its a damn shame they died george burns deserved that oscar he gave a strong comic performance he was also 78 when this movie was filmed so far hes the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age jessica tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress richard benjamin was also fantastic in this he won a golden globe for best supporting actor he deserved that golden globe although many people might disagree with what i am about to say everybody in this film gave a strong performance this comedy is an instant classic i highly recommend it one more thing whoever hates this film is a putz
the neil simons sunshine boys starring walter matthau and george burns is a funny comedy on the strange bond to the life and its shortness but the laughter always bitter taste seeing willy clarkmatthau and al lewisburns two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the imbecility from the hard and unceasing old age you can feel only anger and blue willy not ever surrender and continue to look work while al is tired for players and he is retired to the country in the house to his daughter the couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony but out the scene was a continue squabble and to quarrel and for eleven years after their broken they not talk between now if they would work they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story tv show the meets is explosive and liberating for the old questions
first off i dislike almost all neil simon movies but there is something about this that is unique that draws me in and i would say it is among the most entertaining comedies i have seen the second time i watched it the connection was clear when did neil simon meet my grandmothers br br ah afraid they might sue so he changed them into men and how dull would it be if they were only housewives show biz stars is more fun well this is a personal review and my still living grandmother at age 97 she even outlived walter matthaus magnificent impersonation of herwould deny it  but some of you must find resonance in these charactersbr br secondly i have little tolerance for george burns but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances i can recall and my late grandmother even enjoyed it although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film characterbr br very ethnic in flavor and over the top you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off for me the pleasure lingers
first an explanation despite my headline im giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is not one of the best films ever made all the criticisms registered here have valid points also be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate neil simons brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter he does have a distinctively new york ear for dialogue  especially dry jewish lovesuffused sarcasm  and if you have trouble accepting sarcasm as an expression of love then you might have trouble accepting the optimism at the heart of this moviebr br so much for warnings heres my main point walter matthau is flatout perfect even beyond perfect in this movie i have never seen him funnier or more touching for that matter  because at the same time that he shows us the hilariousness of this character who refuses to give up his big star selfimage or insufferable attitudes even as his coherence is in decline he also shows us the more vulnerable maybe even heartbreakingly scared person inside the grouch and he only barely shows us that sad part  its just enough to really get to you if you happen to be coping with your own fathers or husbands mental decline right now i mention this as a warning but artistically its just enough pathos to give this character the most authentically deep roots im seen in possibly any film performance this is beyond method acting  matthaus performance is exquisite as character work and a pure delight as comic delivery this is a masterpiece of comic actingbr br about richard benjamin i personally find his acting annoying in general and his work in this movie is no exception  although he has some fine moments here chicken is funny is one of them so if you like him you should like him here and if you dont this movie wont change your mindbr br about the 1976 oscarsi agree that matthau was unfortunate to be up against nicholson in cuckoos nest that year it was a killer year for leadingactor competition if only there were separate oscars for comedy and drama then i think the best actor oscars would have gone to al pacino for dog day afternoon and to walter matthau for the sunshine boys  not to dis jacks fine work as mcmurphy but i think that pacino and matthau were each clearly more masterful and astoundingly effective and downright legendary in their performances than nicholson was that year also i believe that burns got the supporting actor oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance  i mean he was good in this movie but not that good burnss fineasever but unexceptionalinitself return to show biz beat brad dourifs truly brilliant debut in cuckoos nest not to mention chris sarandons stunning debut in dog day afternoon  which i think proves my theory br br oscar theories aside heres my bottom line review if you like matthaus comic acting then see this movie and savor his powerhouse tirades and wonderful grandmotherinspired gestures fleeting facial expressions and seemingly unscripted asides but if youre currently dealing with the pain of watching an old person lose his grip then be warned that this movie might either be the comic relief you need or a dose of reality too painful to watch right now
im 14 so you probably would think i have never heard of george burns or walter matthau or anyone like that boy are you wrong i had heard that george burns was in this movie and that he won an academy award for it i have been a fan of george burns since i was ten i saw the movie oh god recently and loved it this one was also very awesome george burns did a great job so did walter matthauthis is the first time ive ever seen him perform and even though they had really small roles phyllis diller and steve allen did a good job that special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done let me say this if you are a fan of george burns or walter matthau you should see this movie right away
at first this looked like a boring comedy like the odd couple but when i got into it it turned out to be a really funny film basically forgetful excomedians willy clark golden globe winner and oscar and bafta nominated walter matthau and al lewis oscar winning and golden glove nominated george burns were a great comedy duo and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a tv show willys nephew ben clark golden globe winning richard benjamin is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings for each other how wrong he is they cannot get on all the time they are both forgetful especially during conversation but they do it eventually also starring lee meredith as nurse in sketch miss mcintosh carol deluise as mrs doris green als daughter rosetta lenoire as odessa willys nurse and muppets from spaces f murray abraham as mechanic i think the best line of the film is burns mentioning that matthau called him a son of a bitch bastard it was nominated the oscars for best art directionset decoration and best writing screenplay adapted from other material it was nominated the bafta for best screenplay and it won the golden globe best motion picture  musicalcomedy and it was nominated for best screenplay very good
the sunshine boys is a terrific comedy about two exvaudevillians who reluctantly reunite for a tv special despite the fact that they despise each otherbr br the comic genius of two masters at work george burns and walter matthau are stellar some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting over the silliest little trivial things the material is fastpaced and witty appealing to all agesbr br mild spoiler alert there are some mildly sad moments toward the end of the movie that deal indirectly with the affects of aging that gives the film a soft sincere tenderness that shows to this reviewer that what the pair really need the most for success are each otherbr br if anyone loves the odd couple youll adore this movie an excellent film
walter matthau and george burns just work so well together the acidity of willy with the perplexed amnesic al is a mixture made in heaven the scene when they meet again in willys flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection walter matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semiretired comedian as only he can the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization george burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable watch for the scene near the end when al and his daughter ask something of the spanish caretaker and als reaction  priceless
stanley and iris show the triumph of the human spirit for stanley its the struggle to become literate and realize his potential for iris its to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow the beauty of the movie is the dance that robert deniro and jane fonda do together starting and stopping before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on in that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is thus being credible unlike some other reviewers i found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture the supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances all in all an excellent movie the best thing i take from it is hope
two great comedians in a great neil simon movie based on his hit playbr br great combination especially when the comedians in question are matthau and burns small wonder why burns won an oscar for this hes as sharp and as funny as ever and matthau is every bit his match if a tad more crotchetybr br this is familiar simon territory two old vaudeville partners reunite for a tv special but still cant stand one another after all these yearsbr br its a delight to watch these two pick at each other their scenes together make this film an absolute delight myself i especially enjoyed the knock knock knock  enter scene and if youre a fan of either burns or matthau youll enjoy it toobr br in fact youll enjoy the whole movie br br ten stars put a little sunshine in your life
as a study of the frailties of human nature in the context of old age this film is without parallel it is quite simply brilliant full marks to everyone  from the scriptwriter to all involved in the finished product you can only marvel at the perceptions inherent in the characterisation of the two ageing performers
much like the comedy duo of its title the sunshine boys has become a forgotten classic 30odd years later its hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the 1970s this makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film perhaps the best neil simon ever wrotebr br walter matthau plays willy clark once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as lewis and clark now a bitter 73yearold solo act who cant get a job in a potato chip commercial his nephew and agent ben richard benjamin is sure he can get work if willy will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner al lewis george burns for an abctv celebration of show business nostalgiabr br nostalgia is what sunshine boys has going for it in spades right from the start when a series of 1920s film clips showcasing various entertainers from long ago flickers before us to the accompaniment of cole porters be a clown then theres the films presentday setting in manhattan where flared trousers and wide polyester ties abound the periods collide in willys glorious mess of a manhattan apartment where framed photos and cartoons of longdead celebrities stare out from the walls at lurid tabloid headlines and empty zabar grocery bags if you were alive in the 1970s like me you might even feel like you were in that apartmentbr br willy clearly has been living there too long hes sleeping in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils willy wakes up and picks up the phonebr br hello who is this a pause never mind its the teabr br old men living alone can be sad material in almost anyone elses hands but simons deft wit and unerring feeling for character turns this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit into comedy gold the amazing thing about the sunshine boys is how much it rubs your noses in willys almost existential condition without turning you off at all 89 years old and just like that he dies of nothing willy says of one old songwriting friend before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed lady with babybr br burns won an oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but steely lewis but its matthau who brings this one home his makeup and proud but ragged bearing really selling you on the idea he was already 73 when he made this willy is obnoxious in the extreme fully deserving bens description crazy freakin old man but you root for him throughout enjoying his small victories even when they come at the cost of others patience his lines kill you too especially when hes trying to kill lewis for whom the tv reunion turns out to be a bad ideabr br youre out of touch willy tells lewis at one point im still in demand im still hotbr br if this room was on fire you wouldnt be hot lewis repliesbr br director herbert ross shoots everything in a very casual and understated way with low lighting and midrange shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the films overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance you never get the feeling you are watching a movie one of the sunshine boys many charms and rosss direction like the acting of the three principals goes a long way toward achieving that endbr br comedy is hard especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by but the sunshine boys makes it all seem a pleasure because for us watching it is
walter matthau and george burns were a famous vaudeville comedy act lewis and clark who havent spoken in over 10 years burns retired and matthau took it personally and has held a grudge ever since such is the premise of this hilarious neil simon play made into a movie of course what makes it so good is matthau and burns in their prime and the material is funnier than anything you can find today richard benjamin shines as matthaus nephew and agent theres even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film and character actor fritz feld starts it all off with a pop rosetta lanoire who started out in the 30s in theater with orson welles and later was grandma on family matters is great in a small rolebr br the only problem i had with it and maybe im being too picky andor serious is the way matthau treats burns when they first meet granted hes had a lot of resentment festering in all these years but some of the things he does would be considered rude or just plain bad manners taken out of context also im used to seeing matthau act that way in other movies but not to george burns and matthaus bellowing tends to get a little old br br all in all if you need a consistently funny film to help and forget your troubles put in the sunshine boys theyll lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and way of lifebr br benjamin you have to slide it br br matthau wait wait i think you have to slide it
an old vaudeville team of willy clark walter matthau and al lewis george burns were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other over 20 years later they agree to get together for a tv specialbut find out they still hate each other willys nephewagent richard benjamin tries to get them to work togetherbr br a big hit in its day and it won george burns an oscar for best supporting actor i somewhat liked it it was written by neil simon so its nonstop oneliners some of it was funny but making jokes of willy and als senility was not also i never liked matthau i never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly all that aside this was fun burns is just great tossing off oneliners with ease and even matthau was good matching him their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie also benjamin is very good as willys nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other for me its worth seeing for burns alone this jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had another hit with oh god so this is good just goodnot great matthaus character really makes this hard to love i give it a 7
the word classic is thrown around too loosely nowadays but this movie well deserves the appelation the combination of neil simon walter matthau possibly the worlds best living comic actor and the late lamented george burns make for a comic masterpiece it is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not death prevented jack benny from playing george burns part as had been planned as it is the reunion scene in matthaus apartment is not likely to be surpassed as a sidesplitter definitely one of my desert island filmsbr br enter
question how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers walther mathau in full furious and brilliant grumpy old man mode answer quietly deadpan and with perfect timing as george burns does herebr br i know nothing of vaudeville but this remains a favourite film the two leads are hilarious the script funny the direction and pacing very fine richard benjamin is very funny as straight man  trying to get at burns through the window etc even the small parts are greatbr br there are so many funny scenes mathau messing up the commercial burns repeating his answers as if senilebr br a delightbr br enterrrrrr
the sunshine boys was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of neil simons play about a retired vaudevillian team played by walter matthau and george burns who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other richard benjamin appears as matthaus nephew a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainmentvaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simons better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau burns and benjamin burns won the best supporting actor oscar for this but i think matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as willy clark matthau was nominated for best actor but didnt stand a chance against nicholson for one flew over the cuckoos nest however in another year this was an oscarworthy performance matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance the scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and cant get the name of the product right is a classic the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between matthau and burns
taking over roles that jack albertson and sam levene played on broadway walter matthau and george burns play a couple of old time vaudeville comics a team in the tradition of joe smith and charles dale who seem to have a differing outlook on lifebr br walter matthau cant stop working the man has never learned to relax take some time and smell the roses hes a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent richard benjamin is finding less and less work for him br br what hurt him badly was that some 15 years earlier his partner george burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family a workaholic like matthau cant comprehend it and take burnss decision personallybr br benjamin hits on a brain storm reunite the guys and do it on a national television special what happens here is pretty hilariousbr br the sunshine boys is also a sad bittersweet story as well about old age matthau is on screen for most of the film but its burns who got the kudos in the form of an oscar at the ripe old age of 79br br burns brought a bit of the personal into this film as well as we all know he was the straight man of the wonderful comedy team of burnsallen who the monty python troop borrowed a lot from in 1958 due to health reasons gracie allen retired and george kept going right up to the age of 100 or at least pretty close to as an active performerbr br the sunshine boys is based on the team of smithdale however and if you like the sunshine boys i strongly recommend you see two tickets to broadway for a look at a pair of guys who were entertaining the american public at the turn of the last century the doctor sketch that matthau and burns do is directly from their materialbr br and i do think you will like the sunshine boys
simons carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by matthau and burns you can literally hear the script crackle there are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script for example the famed reunion scene could have been a lot duller with lessquality actors involved matthau seems to had been born to play willie clark of course oscar moreso in the odd couple and with all of the little idiosyncracies and mannerisms that matthau crams into the character the line where he is arguing that he is with it since he lives in the city whereas lewis lives in the country that lewis is out of touch is the quintessential example of this make this one of the best performances ive ever seen of any actor in any role be it comedic or drama or whatever else period matthau and burns work excellently together the contrast they portray accentuates simons superb knack at creating comedic conflict this movie is simply one of the ultimate mustsees and does demand a rightful prestigious place in the pages of film history
this may not be a memorable classic but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skillbr br the story revolves around iris a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job an illiterate cafeteria worker named stanley iris discovers that stanley is unable to read and after he loses his job she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen of course as you might predict the two although initially wary of involvement develop feelings for each otherbr br jane fonda competently plays iris a woman with problems of her own coping with a job lacking prospects two teenage children one pregnant an unemployed sister and her abusive husband however robert deniro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful but illiterate stanley bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect they arent your typical charming young yuppie couple as generally depicted in on screen romances but an ordinary working class middle aged pair with pretty down to earth strugglesbr br i wont give the ending away but its a lovely heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy albeit from the perspective of a fictional character
neil simons the odd couple set up a model for many of his later plays felix unger and oscar madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original the former being picky and neat the latter being slovenly and loose simon would rewrite less successfully the play in the 1990s as the new odd couple with female roommates he made it a mixed couple a woman with her daughter and a man in the goodbye girls he also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with the sunshine boys a broadway hit starring jack alberson and sam levine as al lewis and willie clark the aged semiretired vaudevillians here the apartment problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who cant stand each other the 1976 film starred walter matthau as willie and george burns as albr br in actuality al probably does not think totally badly of willie  willie is pathological on the subject of al first al had little habits such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter t and slightly jabbing willie with his index finger on stage secondly al retired when his wife died willie was not ready to retire and has been forcing his nephew and agent ben richard benjamin to try to get him jobs in commercials but willie cant remember lines unless they are funny and keeps flubbing them so he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercialbr br ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about american comedy he does bring al to see willie and the sparks begin flying as neither can figure out what the other is doing and this is just in rehearsal on top of that willie is insisting on changes minor ones but they throw off al such as saying enter when al knocks on the door the initial rehearsal is a failure but ben manages to get them to the taping of the show the question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will willie wring als neckbr br the three leads matthau burns and benjamin do very well with the oneliners frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter example chest painsim getting chest pains uncle willie every thursday i come here and get chest pains so come on fridays benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle although matthaus rough outer shell makes it difficult he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville matthau has a little better grasp on reality at first than burns who seems senile by his repeating himself  but in actuality matthaus sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly burns is not senile  he takes things slowly but he seems far happier in accepting his retirementbr br i call this a final voyage of discovery for our modern lewis and clark al and willie transcend their old skits as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought even the irascible willie admits that al may be to him a pain in the ass but he was a funny manbr br burns was not the original choice for the part of al lewis supposedly dale of the team smith and dale jack benny was benny probably would have done a good job but illhealth forced him out he died in 1975 burns whose last involvement in any film was in the solid gold cadillac in 1956 as the narrator turned in such a fine performance that he got the oscar for best supporting actor and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as oh god oh god you devil and going in style he died in 1996 age 100 having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife gracie allan
i remember originally seeing this film at radio city music hall when it came out i didnt really understand the humor back then but this movie can make me laugh out loudbr br with all due respect to george burns rip walter matthau really deserved the oscar for this film his performance is amazinggiven the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character willie clark his mannerisms are firstrate you know what kind of songs he wrote sht and when speaking to the spanishspeaking guy at the front desk no no no enchilada absolutely hilariousbr br kudos to richard benjamin who played straight man to matthaubr br i just wish this was on dvd because my vhs recording is getting a bit oldbr br i had no interest in seeing the remake with woody allen because in no way can it match the original
a hilarious neil simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end the late walter matthau is the grouchy excomedian who is persuaded to join together with his expartner the late oscarwinner george burns for a final reunion show on stagebr br benjamin martin is matthaus agent and nephew and the two have just as much chemistry as matthau and burns i love matthaus grumpy characterhes just the same as he always is and yet also very differentbr br burns as the absentminded old man is just as funny as matthaubr br matthau want some crackers ive got coconut pineapple and grahambr br burns how about a plain crackerbr br matthau i dont got plain i got coconut pineapple and grahambr br burns okaybr br matthau theyre in the cupboard in the kitchenbr br burns maybe laterbr br or how about thisbr br matthau when i did black the whites knew what i was sayingbr br youve got to see it in the movie to understand itbr br all in all a refreshingly hilarious sweet heartfelt warm belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time br br they just dont make them like this anymore in a time when all the newest comedies are crude juvenile and stupid this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really isfunny characters smart and funny dialogue and grand entertainmentbr br one of the best buddy comedies of all time right up there with planes trains and automobiles lethal weapon and the hard waybr br you may have a hard time finding this for rent or on tv but trust me it will be worth your timebr br 455 starsbr br  john ulmer
in one of neil simons best plays creaky cranky exvaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are teaming up for a tv comedy special the problem is they havent even seen each other in over a decade full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes this story flies along with a steady stream of humor good work also by richard benjamin as the harried nephew rosetta lenoire as the nurse and howard hesseman as the tv commercial director steve allen and phyllis diller appear as themselves trivia note the opening montage contains footage from hollywood revue of 1929 and shows marie dressler bessie love polly moran cliff edwards charles king gus edwards and the singing brox sisters
the sunshine boys is one of my favorite feel good movies i first saw it when it as the christmas attraction at radio city music hall when it first came out and loved it ever since i ended up seeing it 6 times in the theaters and if it was playing today id go out to see it againbr br now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads matthau was brilliant but had the misfortune of being nominated against jack nicholsons oscar winning performance of randall p macmurphy in one flew over the cuckoos nest burns did win though richard benjiman deserved at least to be nominated as well even the smallest roles were played to perfection like fritz feld auditioning for the potato chips commercial br br which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film the direction of the greatly underrated herbert ross ross who previously brought a two person play the owl and the pussycat to the screen and made a full movie out of it does it again he opens the plays out without making them look like a photographic stage play he fleashens out the story and the charactersbr br here were 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play where ben clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes the sequence itself is totally new a few years ago i did see at the broadway revival of the play with jack klugman and tony randall which was wonderful but i think that ross and screenwriter playwright simon improved on it its just a wonderful film
this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniels and ruby keeler when i watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd street especially the character eloise whos a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle like bebe daniels did in 42nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star this film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era the dancing styles the music dressing styles youll love it this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood it would of had better scenery better filming and more money which would make any movie better but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has i have to say out of all micheauxs films swing is the best the movie features singers dancers actresses and actors who were popular but forgotten today doli armena a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky the sexy hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shamebr br adding further info popular blues singer of the 20s and 30s cora green is the focus of the film shes mandy a good hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women a nosy neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive curvy woman by the name of eloise played hazel diaz a hotcha entertainer in the 30s and a fight breaks out then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle lena provides mandy with a home a job and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith played by hazel i guess shes playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy tall long lanky but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him he might shape up there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith hazel diaz struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but thats not enough she almost gets into a fight with mandy again in between theres great entertainment by chorus girls tap dancers shake dancers swing music and blues singing theres even white people watching the entertainment i wonder where micheaux found them theres even a scene where theres blacks and whites sitting together at the club micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films he should be commended for such a bold movebr br this movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux this movie is one of the best of the race film genre its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show businessbr br no these early race films may not be the best cant be compared with hallelujah green pastures stormy weather cabin in the sky carmen jones or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black filmmaking and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black persons eyes these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life be beautiful classy and elegant and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood most of the actors and actresses of these race films werent the best but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time micheaux and spencer williams couldnt afford nina mae mckinney josephine baker ethel waters fredi washington paul robeson rex ingram and more of the bigger stars so micheaux and other black and white race filmmakers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some werent great actors and actresses but i think micheaux and others knew most werent good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films for some true actorsactresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they didnt want to play hollywood stereotypes so i think youll be able to spot the true actorsactresses from the nightclub performers these race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films arent the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films didnt start out great in the beginning i think if the race film genre continued it would have better if your looking for great acting most race films arent the ones but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast moon over harlem body and soul paradise in harlem keep punching sunday sinners dark manhattan broken strings boy what a girl mystery in swing miracle in harlem and sepia cinderella that not only has good entertainment but good acting
br br one of the best films ive ever seen robert duvalls performance was excellent and outstanding he did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life his character was so convincing it made me almost think i were in the theater watching it live i give it 5 stars
robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e lee according the imdbcom movie database after seeing this film you may think duvalls appearance is reincarnation at its best one of my most favorite films i wish the composer peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available wonderful scenery and music and all tootruetolife especially for those of us that live in or have moved to the south this is a real moment in time life moves on slowly but strangers we do not remain
convicts is very much a third act sort of film all the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long winddown of a late southern day and by extension the life of its main character soll robert duvallbr br this is the first collaboration of director peter masterson and writer horton foote six years earlier the worked together on the trip to bountiful a film that seems almost actionpacked in comparison to this one masterson is not necessarily a good director in fact hes just barely this side of adequate the slow pace leaves a lot of room for cinematographer toyomichi kurita who infuses the film with just the right sense of fragile light  warmthbr br because this is essentially a filmed play with little in the way of editing or directing prowess it all comes to the acting as far as im concerned theres no flaws here robert duvall and james earl jones two of the best american actors both born in january 1931 create characters that are wholly real uninterested in anything besides living lukas haas a young actor who i was familiar with from testament and witness plays a character very much like his other early roles he is quiet withdrawn slightly scared and sad somehow these are qualities that seem natural from himbr br perhaps a title like convicts is a disservice to this film that title along with the opening scene seem to create an image of a far more highstrung western type picture if slowpaced stage productions dont interest you terribly youll want to pass on this one as well otherwise this might be exactly the film you wish they made more oftenbr br enjoy
in todays world of digital fabrication there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer alas this type of character driven film is far too rare these days duvalls performance as well as james earl jones are faithful to their audiences high expectations i wonder if this movie was made for tv it has a closeup personal quality to the narrative it is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding the only thing that keeps it from being a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a great cinematographer but pretty pictures are not everything how can talent the likes of jones and duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing
if you fast forward through the horrible singing you will find a classic fairy tale underneath christopher walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role his trademark style of acting works well for the sly puss in boots the other actors are well for their parts i did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward the king in particular appears a real dunce though and i wonder if he is supposed to be i can not remember the original tale the special effects are typical of the eighties but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today overall i recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart
when i first saw this film on cable it instantly became one of my favorite movies im a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes most of the attitudes came from soll an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor soll is what makes the move his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimers disease none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex while he has racist views hes grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black the two convicts he trusts most are jacksonmel winkler and benjames earl jones the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie they have real chemistry james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hassbr br this movie should have gotten more notoriety however its on dvd and worth the moneybr br rayvyn
this is a very enjoyable film with excellent actors and actresses evoking a range of emotions it contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy you get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs and it ends very upbeat
what a delightful movie the characters were not only lively but alive mirroring real every day life and strife within a family each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friendsbr br the story has a truetolife flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops the script does a good job of capturing the common emotions actions and reactions of the characters to conflict opinion and resolvebr br not an epic but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones plenty of knowing head nods and ahhh moments to share and enjoy
i actually found this movie interesting finally one worth my time to watch and rent it is true some scenes were over the top on emotionalism shouting etc but what movie doesnt stress its agenda genre or ax to grind almost none what surprised me is that i read a review elsewhere done by a sfran reviewer on another review site but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his own review of the movie not of the movie at all anyone that watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends no car chases yea being in an italian family myself i can fully relate to the environment portrayed on the screen the movie has its tear jerking parts as well it is what real life can be in such an environment nice movie
ive always knew anne desalvo was a great character actor now i know she is a great writerdirector also i have been a fan since i first saw her in the movies perfect my favorite year dc cab and stardust memoriesbr br its so rare to see lee grant these days in anything she has been missing from the screen for far too long its also wonderful to see cloris leachman in something other than a sitcom this is her best work since the last picture show if you grew up in an italian american family you will love this movie i wasnt expecting a lot when i started watching this movie so i was pleasantly surprised when i fell in love with this movie if you get the chance watch it
a wonderful movie anyone growing up in an italian family will definitely see themselves in these characters a good family movie with sadness humor and very good acting from all you will enjoy this movie we need more like it
it is a rare occasion when i want to see a movie again the amati girls is such a movie in old time movie theaters i would have stayed put for more showings was this story autobiographical for the writerdirector it has the aura of realitybr br the all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness who would not want mercedes ruehl as an older sister i have loved her work since for roseannabr br with most movies one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors producers directors sound technicians etc it was hard to suspend such belief in the amati girls one feels such a part of this family how i wanted to come to the defense of dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life and wanted to cheer lee grant as she levels criticism at cloris leachmans hair color the humor throughout is not belly laugh humor but instead has a feelgood quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and suchbr br the love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherishedbr br it is no coincidence that the family name amati translated from the italian means the loved ones
growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20s and 30s i grew up very close to most of the italian families living there this move brought back so many pleasant memories this is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies
can scarcely imagine a better movie than thisbr br hey before you all go chick flick on me i am a very large strong  masculine macho man who happens to think this was one of the better movies of the last 20 years br br the acting was superb and the story was marvelous this is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul the acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast br br i have known for a good while that mercedes ruehl along with holly hunter joan plowright dame edith evans sissy spacek judi dench is among the greatest actresses ever to appear on film and of course cloris leachman also in this film in my view may in fact exceed them all in the shear magnum of her talent and varied roles she has appeared in over the years at any rate this was an amazing cast this film was like a book that you cannot lay down and when you have reached the last page wish for morestill more i cannot for the life of me understand why this film here on the imdb only rates a 39br br that rating here is utterly amazing to me or perhaps not perhaps in fact i do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad it makes me ever so sad that films like american beauty leaving las vegas sexy beast and fight club ratings skyrocket off the charts in popularity when they in fact at least in this viewers opinion should have received an r ratingr that is for rubbish hey ok i realize there are a lot of different stories in this world for a lot of different audiences but it is a sad commentary when this lovely powerfulextraordinarily directed acted and written film seems to be over looked br br it obviously was at the academy awards as wellhow sad and how predictable my summation is that if you want to see a powerful happy sad beautiful story watch preferably own this film
i watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and i can say that i didnt have the best time mainly because i didnt know about ned kelly or his storybr br but since this is a biopic its important to at least know what to expect from the characterbr br i dont know if the manner the events are told are true or if it everything is fictional but the way ned kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true i dont think hes portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief but thats just my opinionbr br this is a solid westerntype movie for everybodys tastes heath ledger is great as always and the sexy naomi watts charms the screenbr br give this movie a chance if it airs on cable otherwise i dont think i could recommend it
ok so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally poorly sung though walken and marner particularly walken sounded pretty good and so they shattered the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his nobles sing about the battle with the ogre and praise the efforts of puss in boots when they by rights shouldnt have even known about itbr br who cares its christopher freakin walken doing a movie based on a fairy tale and he sings and dances his acting style fits the role very well as the devious mischievous puss who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan hes thought about seven or eight moves in advance and if youve ever seen walken in any of his villainous roles you know the ogre bit the dust hard at the end when walken got him into his trapbr br a fun film and a mustsee for anyone who enjoys the unique style of christopher walken
fantastic movie one to excite all 5 senses is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information true hollywood conventions used like playing a list and very attractive actors as the heroes such as naomi watts julia cook  ned kellys lover heath ledger ned and orlando bloom joe byrne  neds right hand man and unattractive sorry geoffrey rush actors play the drunken and corrupt victorian police force this also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between ned ledger and julia cook watts to entice all the romantics females being especially susceptible even from the first scene when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him sunshine and had a glint in his eye as he looked down at me his hand on me shoulder it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with ned kelly the underdog besides dont all aussies love an underdog
im tired of people judging films on their historical accuracy its a movie people the writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story there are a number of movies out there that arent entirely accurate with the historybraveheart wyatt earp gangs of new york geronimo an american legend the last of the mohicansall fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically if you want to see a few great actors do what they do best then i suggest you see this film and dont worry about the accuracy of the facts just enjoy the quality of the film the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time
i thought that this film was very well made heath leger was very convincing and his irish accent was flawless orlando bloom and naomi watts were also really good and believable how true it is to what really happened i have no idea but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over 30000 signed a petition for ned kelly not to be hanged so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it didnt do better in the cinemas
definitely one of my favourite movies the story is good acting is great all technicals especially cinematography are sharp and the script is cleverbr br heath ledger is terrific as edward ned kelly he is gripping as the legendary outlaw and is supported well by geoffrey rush naomi watts and orlando bloom all action sequences are on pointbr br the film is edgeofyour seat stuff right up to to the end one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in and makes no mistake herebr br an excellent film all round
i didnt know what to expect from ned kelly but absolutely loved it it was dark dramatic and gripping it also felt very authentic i felt that i had been transported back to the 1800s ive never been much of a heath ledger fan having only seen him in teen type movies however he is quite compelling in this role ledger plays ned kelly with dignity and intensity showing us how an highly spirited boy became australias most notorious killer naomi watts is great in a supporting role as kellys society lover highly recommended  and thats from an aussie
the only reason i wanted to see this was because of orlando bloom simply put the movie was spectacularly average its not bad but its really not very good the editing is good the film is wellpaced the direction is competent and assured the story is plodding the film is averagely acted by ledger bloom and the normally great watts and rush the accents are impenetrable if youre from the us so just sit back and enjoy the scenery or as i like to call it orlando bloom by the end of the film i was neither bored nor moved some people have asked what happened to ned kelly at the end of the movie i have to say i so did not care by that pointbr br really the only reason i can recommend this is that orlando bloom kind of sort of shows some hints of range although the oftpresent im pretty and confused look is prominent so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price other than that just dont see it its neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining
how could i possibly pass up the chance to see orlando bloom and heath ledger together well i couldnt and so i rented this mess of a moviebr br i had never heard of ned kelly and was surprised by what i found out about this young mans legend i was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was perhaps the fact that it was very very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow i found this story difficult to follow not because the story is complicated but because it is slow even with a slow story ledger and bloom managed to create interesting dimensional characters br br though i flounder to recommend this as a must see it is a great story of australian history considering how young the country is this is very rare and should be appreciated and the film does have some good actions sequences br br 610 see it for historical valueyeah rightand thats the only reason to see it  
i loves this moviebecause it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that the language is very mild and sometimes dont even know it is there this movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killers i hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one there is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned looked at also that that is how people remember themfrom their armor i hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as i have
ned kelly is a wonderfully made australian film honouring a true australian hero we are taken into the world of ned his best friend joe byrne and the other members of the kelly gang as the film explains and perhaps justifies neds actionsbr br there is an exceptional cast present who all give stellar performances which brings the film to life great job heath orlando bloom was fantastic as joe playing the role of quiet loyal ladiesman very well i was swept up in the moment for a moment i almost believed the gang would win the battle at glenrowan alas it was not to bebr br some aspects of the film are fictional and as an avid ned kelly fan and supporter was slightly disappointed by this perhaps also the film couldve gone longer to cover more of the kelly gangsneds life  i felt not enough was coveredbr br regardless of a few flaws this is a moving film which stirs all sorts of emotions and hey id assume this film would be better to watch rather than mick jagger trying to portray ned
i have seen the trailer for this movie several times over and i have to say that ned kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film when i saw the trailer for the first time i could not take my eyes away from it it got my attention for sure heath ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him period pieces not to mention orlando bloom who is seen for a split second looks fantastic i think that this movie will be a hit and will be seen over and over again my many people
although this was obviously a lowbudget production the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing one of walkens few musical roles to date he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well  watch for the cartwheel also starring jason connery a great childrens story and very likable characters
those who know who know the kelly legend  are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film eg naomi watts character never existed in reality but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment it holds up pretty well ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid taking the mantle of cinemas best ned not hard considering the previous neds include yahoo serious mick jagger  former carlton champion australian rules football bob chitty a great footballer but a poor actor some location shooting film in the area i live bacchus marsh outside melbourne as well as clunes  ballarat
had ned kelly been born later he probably would have won a victoria cross at gallipolli such was neds braverybr br in australia and especially country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and immediately recognised in greta he is still a hero the life blood of the town of jerilderie depends on the tourism he created but in mansfield they still havent forgotten that the three policeman that he murdered were from therebr br many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing from the old melbourne gaol where he was hanged to the post office he held up in jerilderie a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in benella and the site of ann jones hotel the station and even the logs where he was captured in glenrowan can be visitedbr br evidence of all the events in the movie except for his love interest can be found all over victoria in police records and even in the sash that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning none of this is wrong and whats left out would further justify neds actions the horse that ned stole was actually stolen by wild wright the man who ned boxes with after getting out of jail ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldnt have stolen itbr br the jerilderie letter is more than what has been stated before it is not self justification it is neds biography an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting so go ahead and read it watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ned stood for
the performances were superb the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a victorian living historian i was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detailbr br i wouldnt say you need any knowledge of the kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge do not expect as some rather silly people do any of the characters to have the auzzie accent as we know it it was at that time a country during infancybr br ok the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film gregor jordan said in the extra feature on the dvd that he wanted his movie to inspire an interest and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up herebr br see it and you will not be sorry
the story of ned kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand and this film is no exception what ensures ned kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him during several battles he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce indeed it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the victorian police who noticed he hadnt plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged the story has been told in schools and histories of australia for so long that some permutations of the story have ironically become boring the more the stories try to portray kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster the less people pay attentionbr br which is where this adaptation of our sunshine a novel about the kelly legend excels rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore the film quickly establishes him as a human being indeed the reversal of the popular legend showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd here ned kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it no i am not making that up about the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the irish versus english mentality of the battles while the kelly gang were distinctly irish australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly a scene with some chinese migrants highlights thisbr br heath ledger does an amazing job of impersonating australias most notorious outlaw it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not kelly himself orlando bloom has finally found a role in which he doesnt look completely lost without his bow and geoffrey rushs appearance as the leader of the police contingent at glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state but it is naomi watts appearing as julia cook who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kellys life but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here indeed a lot of the films hundred and ten minutes feels more freezedried than explorative once the element of police corruption is established in fact the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushedbr br unfortunately most of the films strengths are not capitalised upon rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits ditto for watts and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins i can only conclude that another fifteen or even thirty minutes of footage might have fixed this but that leads to the other problem in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact one scene manages to do the speechmaking thing well but unfortunately it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while if one were to believe the impression that this film creates a matter of weeks even days passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the sayso of one corrupt policeman and the infamous shootout at glenrowan annoyingly the trial and execution of ned kelly is not even depicted here simply referred to in subtitles before the credits rollbr br that said aside from some shaky camerawork at times ned kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts and it has a good beginning for that reason i rated it a seven out of ten other critics have not been so kind so if youre not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout then you might be better off looking elsewhere especially if you want a more factual account of ned kellys life
im sure that not many people outside of australia have ever heard of the legend of ned kelly i once saw a documentary about the man but thats the only time i once saw or heard anything about him and i guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face noone knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subjectbr br the movie tells the story of ned kellys life the irish immigrant has lived in northwest victoria all his life but has never been very welcome by the authorities the police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family when kelly is fed up with the way everything goes he forms a gang with his brother and two other men they start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days all this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen they are outlawed finally they take over a pub in glenrowan where they have a party with all the visitors waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up but the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmenbr br its very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false i guess nobody really knows because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth one camp says he was a hero some kind of robin hood the others will say he was an ordinary criminal a murderer and a thief i really couldnt tell you which of them is right perhaps both are but what i can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the samebr br this movie was a nice addition to the documentary i once saw and i really enjoyed the performances of all the actors heath ledger orlando bloom naomi watts geoffrey rush are all actors who are pretty well known but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like i really enjoyed this movie and i give it a 7510
there are few films that leave me with the feeling that gregor jordans ned kelly film did initially i had heard only half hearted recommendations and decided to see it for myself since then i have acquired both the video and soundtrack and have to say that after several viewings i am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film it is also wonderful to see something australian i appreciate its down to earth quality that if you ask me is a rarity as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films this film proves that you dont necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point the cast was a bonus including a variety of well known and might i add good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters it is interesting to note that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what and how they only said so many lines however if any criticism is due it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded in reality these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in australian history for example on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much much more to the relationship between joe byrne and aaron sheritt and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film also overlooked was the fact that it was not only aaron sheritts efforts alone that provided the victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery yes this is their interpretation of the story and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention i feel that in this case this is the only limitation however i can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation it certainly inspired me to look more closely so watch it and decide for yourself you might not like it at all thats your opinion and thats fine maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an australian audience for me id call it a breath of fresh air
due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldnt believe how bad it was i didnt go and see this film at the cinema after watching it on dvd i have to say i regret that now im not saying it is brilliant but i would venture to say that it is a good movie i enjoyed itbr br people have skulls thicker than neds helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary if you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal i dont think ganghis kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact what kind of man ned kelly actually was is a matter of debate and quite passionate it seems in spite of the efforts of governments and some historians ned kelly has become a legend legends are stories and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself ned kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of australian culture that doesnt trust or accept authority a society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushrangerbr br so not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical kelly gang i actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie it was sentimental and romantic but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been for my fellow australians watch the lighthorseman and you will see what i mean it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas such as the shooting of the troopers ironically i actually enjoyed the movie because of that because it would be those details that most of the focus on neds story would dwell and they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historiansbr br this movie was always going to have a hard time having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market to pay the pills and the legend as it means to australians perhaps a little of neds spirit is in this movie because i think it rebelled against peoples expectations and unfortunately missed both targets fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film for me it was an unexpected kind of movie about ned and that is why i liked it orlando blooms performance did a lot for the movie too  he really added something i think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf for a changebr br when you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered send me this on dvd for christmas rather than croc dundee or the man from snowy river anytime
spoilers all too in real life as well as in the movies familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun or rifle in their hands the case of young and innocent in never handling or firing a gun jimmy davis franchot tone has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men like jimmy davis are forced to take up arms for their countrybr br jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the us army but was encouraged to stay by being belted in the mouth by his good friend fred p willis spencer tracy ended up on the front lines in france with jimmys unit pinned down by a german machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen german soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple it was when jimmy gunned down the last surviving german who raised his arms in surrender that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding himbr br recovering from his wounds at an army hospital jimmy fell in love with us army volunteer nurse rose duffy gladys george rose was really in love with jimmys good friend the happy go lucky fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her its when fred was lost during the fighting on the western front that rose thinking that he was killed fell in love and later married jimmy when fred unexpectedly showed up in the french town where jimmy now fully recovered from his wounds was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and rose who had already accepted jimmys proposal of marriage to herbr br with wwi over and jimmy marrying rose left fred whos still in love with her a bitter and resentful young man it was almost by accident that fred ran into jimmy on the streets of new york city and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and nonviolent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the european western front smug and sure of himself and his ability to shoot a gun jimmy had become a top mobster in new york citys underworld not only that but as fred later found out his wife rose had no idea what jimmy was really involved in with jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjusterbr br jimmys life of crime came full circle when rose after she found out about his secret life ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a valentine day like massacre with his gang members dressed as cops of his rival mobsters while on trial jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then after his three year sentence is up get his life back together br br spoiler alert hearing rumors from fellow convicts that rose and his best friend fred were having an affair behind his back jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law its at freds circus where he works as both manger and barker that jimmy in seeing that rose as well as fred were true to him that he like at his trial had a sudden change of heart but the thought of going back to prison with at least another ten years added on to his sentence was just too much for jimmy it was then that jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job that he himself didnt have the heart to do for him
sandwiched in between san francisco and captains courageous two of spencer tracys greatest parts is this very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people they gave him a gun stars spencer tracy and franchot tone in the only film they ever made together and gladys george as the woman who loves them bothbr br tracy and tone are a couple of world war i draftees tone is a weak character who almost goes over the hill in boot camp but tracy stops him tracy is still playing the lovable blowhard younger wallace beery type that mgm envisioned for him when they signed him away from fox br br over at the front tone gets an opportunity and takes it when during a fight he manages to get to a church tower that peers down on a german machine gun nest hes learned to shoot by now and he does a sergeant york but alvin c york was never changed by the war the way tone hasbr br wounded in the fight tone convalesces at a hospital with gladys george looking out for him tracy goes awol himself to visit his pal and he and george get something going later on when tracy is reported missing in action tone and george marry tracys brokenhearted when he comes back and learns of the marriage but takes sit in stride br br the rest of the film is dealing with tone applying the the wartime skills hes learned to the gangster trade hes a hitman now and george doesnt really know what he does for a living i think you can figure the rest outbr br the part of the film that gave me some trouble is that i cant believe gladys george couldnt figure it out shes a street smart girl her part is very much like the one she played in the roaring twenties opposite james cagneybr br speaking of the roaring twenties humphrey bogarts character development there is similar to tones although he was not the central character of the movie in fact there are elements of they gave him a gun that are to be found in taxi driver and in clint eastwoods classic the unforgiven br br the world war i battle sequences are very well staged by director woody van dyke for some reason leonard maltin panned this film i think its a lot better than he gave it credit
for a danish movie i have to say that this is very good moviebr br its in a class of its own yet it has an international potentialbr br the movie has a big budget and is starring famous danish actors and a few newcomers who play very well it can be watched by anyone who like adventures and a little bit of ghost moviebr br dont be afraid be thrilled
i never saw this when i was a kid so this was seen with fresh eyes i had never heard of it and rented it for my 5 year old daughter plus the idea of christopher walken singing and dancing made me curious the special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre but the story is great my daughter was entranced i loved watching walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him very amusing to see him dance and if the songs werent great at least they werent disney overproduced saccharine sweetness the ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end but it was mostly benign interestingly we had recently read puss in boots and i had wondered about the implausibility of the story but while staying true to almost every aspect walkens acting made it believable great fun id watch it again with my daughter
wow a danish movie with this kind of content i mean the actors the story the pictures the efx  everything was where it should be br br and a danish efx house producing those vfx  wow this is like the 2nd or 3rd time a danish fx has produces visual effects in that qualitybr br spoiler ahead the twist with the ghostly children in the submarine was quite good but generally i did not feel the big chill which i would expect from a ghostmovie end of spoilerbr br but anyway this is a danish movie which i as a dane can be proud ofbr br the only bad about this is that it wasnt a danish director but a swedish
i went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister instead i had to really control myself in order to convince her that i was not scared in many ways still a children´s story but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience
spoilers spoilersbr br this movie the divers is really interesting all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish but i decided to check it out for one reason the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine ive got a fetish for german subs especially wrecks that can be dived upon so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part knowing that nordic films arent always that good and not sure of the budget size i was to say the least very scepticalbr br upon viewing i was  surprisedbr br i had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate seeing how some are very young the two main actors in particular this was not an issue they both perform very well as do the other actors who mostly consist of people in their 50s and beyond this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old not often seen on the screen not unique in anyway but somewhat rare and its all goodbr br as for the danish language it is nearly impossible to understand but this was no problem it had subtitlesbr br another issue was the submarine itself i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine having decided their budget was slim i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at its worst again i was surprised the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic having a fetish for german subs i knew what the sub should look like especially inside and was not let down the team has done some serious research its all goodbr br i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a warning the submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war its a special purpose sub but to give you a hint of what to expect its a crossing between a type vii type ix and a japanese transport sub similar to i52 its god a good design and makes a nice wreckbr br the setting is on a danish island or peninsula i cant remember its summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year their grandfather is a mariner of sorts the cinematography is quite nice a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks some newfound teenage love nice diving weather and a general feeling of perfect once again its all goodbr br plotwise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind a gathering of men hire one of the boats an old minesweeper and its crew one of the visitors a man in his 50s has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back the islands senior citizens all remember when a german uboat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken uboat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in 1945 no submarine was ever foundbr br what to expectbr br key elements are nazi experiments nazi history treasure hunting secrecy competition teen love conspiracy and a surprisebr br  warning  spoiler br br i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard not being a big fan of supernatural events it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem its not like from dusk til dawn where everybody turns into vampires towards the end this is a bit more subtlebr br overall  really good movie i gave it an 8 some due to the fact that it isnt a hollywood movie with unlimited resources i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans but even if this had been a hollywood production i would give it a 7 or 8 definately worth your while yes a childs story in a way but then again a mature tale it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure which i found very appealing and again the cinematography is really nicebr br medusa 2001br br 
this was a strong poirotsuchet television mystery selection the characters were vivid and wellacted the plot and the main settinga student hostel were excellent japp was nothing special but for me did not distract from story one significant point many poirot watchers dont recognize good acting or good characterization i also think they are rather harsh in their judgments of some of the poirot mysteries finally i have read few christie novelsnone in recent years and find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about changes from the novel please viewers consider what is presented to you on film not what you think should be there that said the poirot mysteries vary in quality but not as much as reviewers and raters would have you believe with the singular exception of the five little pigs which was fabulous in plot character and theme the longer poirot films are neither that good or that bad for the record i have seen all the longer poirotsuchet films finally films without lemon hastings andor japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence there presence however is either obtrusive almost always with japp or irrelevant with hastings lemon is in the middle
hickory dickory dock was a good poirot mystery i confess i have not read the book despite being an avid agatha christie fan the adaptation isnt without its problems there were times when the humour and there were valiant attempts to get it right was a little overdone and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded however i loved how hickory dickory dock was filmed it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant abc murders and it really set the atmosphere what with the dark camera work and dark lighting the darker moments were somewhat creepy this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two buckle my shoe which gave me nightmares the plot is complex with all the essential ingredients though not as convoluted as buckle my shoeand in some way that is a good thing the acting was very good david suchet is impeccablei know i cant use this word forever but i cant think of a better word to describe his performance in the series as poirot and phillip jackson and pauline moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole particularly damian lewis as leonard all in all solid mystery but doesnt rank along the best 7510 bethany cox
a series of random seemingly insignificant thefts at her sisters boarding house has miss lemon quite agitated a ring light bulbs a rucksack a lighter a stethoscope a shoe  there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it miss lemon asks her employer the great belgian detective hercule poirot to look into the matter but what poirot sees is something far more sinister than miss lemon could have imagined and poirots fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered its up to poirot to bring a killer to justicebr br hickory dickory dock is a solid but not spectacular entry in the long running poirot series i appreciate how faithful the script is to agatha christies original story i realize that certain liberties had to be taken but i appreciate the effort nonetheless the major points of the mystery are all there  the petty thefts the boarding house the students the ripped rucksack and of course poirots ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens with a few exceptions the cast of students is almost as i pictured them damian lewis and jessica lloyd standout among the group as mush as i always enjoy david suchets poirot i get a real kick out of the episodes with phillip jacksons inspector japp and pauline morans miss lemon this episode is a real treat as miss lemon gets more screen time than usual finally i enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel its a fun little play on the hickory dickory dock titlebr br i realized while rewatching hickory dickory dock just what a tremendous influence agatha christies work was on the highly stylized italian mystery films or gialli of the 60s and 70s take the murder of mrs nicoletis as an example if you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene you would have something straight out of an early 70s giallo in fact the entire plot of hickory dickory dock could have been used in a giallo its just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked
this story was never among my favourites in christies works so i was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation the mouse motif was effective if a little overdone the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the crime in the past subplot the students were all pretty much as i imagined them although its a pity they werent a more cosmopolitan bunch  perhaps the revised thirties setting didnt allow for that i thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming perhaps its because ive not long reread the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early onbr br humour was much more prevalent in these early poirots sometimes it works but i found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode though i did smile at the lemon sole throwaway line altogether though a solid entry in the series though not one of the best
it all begins with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects in a hostel for students on hickory road london concerned for her sister who is the housekeeper there miss lemon asks hercule poirot to look into the matter he agrees but soon the stakes get higher when a girl who had admitted that she was responsible for most not all of the thefts is found murderedbr br hickory dickory dock is a solid brain exercise without being as mindnumbingly complicated as one two buckle my shoe murder theft and diamond smuggling are the crimes involved and the final twist that ties everything together is revealed only in the last 2 minutes the characters are interesting particularly the psychology student colin mcnabb and the mysterious american girl sally finch inspector japp has his funny moments in perhaps the closest this series has come to toilet humor and miss lemon gets a more integral part to the story than usual 
i loved dedee pfeiffer is that spelled right in cybil havent seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her i thought she did a great job in this the supporting cast was pretty good too in some angles the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman the abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists the young boyfriend was a hottie i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for surebr br just got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies kept my interest and ill watch it again when they rerun it can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want thanks in advance aboutagirly
im a fan of tv movies in general and this was one of the good ones the cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists i didnt see coming before each commercial to me it was kind of like medium meets csibr br did anyone else think that in certain lights the daughter looked like a young nicole kidman are they related in any way id definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to videobr br dedee was great havent seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very convincinglybr br if youre into to tv mystery movies check this one out if you have a chance
when i was a kid i watched this many times over and i remember whistling the happy cat song quite often all the songs are great and actually memorable unlike many childrens musicals where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason the scenes and costumes are lavish and the acting is very welldone which isnt surprising considering the cast christopher walken is very catlike and doesnt need stupid makeup or a cat costume for the viewer to believe hes a cat transformed to a human and jason connerys so cute as the shy and awkward millers son corin who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera this is a really fun enjoyable featurelength movie where unlike most fairytales the characters are given personalities some of my favourite parts are when puss makes corin pretend hes drowning at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance as its all the rage abroad when walken is in the kitchen dancing on the table hes a pretty good dancer too and when vera tells corin all the things she used to do when she was young like pretending she was a millers daughter id recommend this film to children and parents alike who love magic and fairytales and it actually is a movie you can watch together as it wont drive adults up the wall
i have to say seventeen  missing is much better than i expected the perception i took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but i was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mysterybr br dedee pfeiffer is emilie a mom who insists her daughter lori tegan moss not attend a socalled graduation party one weeknight but lori ignores her mothers wishes and takes off for the party anyway when lori does not come home emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearancebr br seventeen  missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type as it is not so predictable pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie and most of it comes off as believable this lmn original movie premiered last night 1010
its all about mitzi i loved her in this and didnt she look fantastic i love these lifetime sunday afternoon popcorn movies this is like one of those nailbiters where they always go to commercial at the most annoying times the richard character was completely creepy ive dated guys like that well not totally like that lol i wish zack hadnt have gotten killed he was a cutie and very easy on the eyes i love these stalker type stories it always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked my husband doesnt usually like these types of movies but actually sat through the entire thing with me and actually enjoyed it i cant wait to see what mitzi does next
loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel managerthe movie was presented well with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter the progression of situations were cleverly writtenmaking me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what i thought might be the obvious too bad there have to be commercialsi have told many friends to watch for further showings and i of course will view againi enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue husband and wife heated discussionsor should i say fights were very realisticthe initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is noti want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film thank you looking forward to the next filmswhen whidbey
its hard for me to criticize anything that mitzi kapture does she just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress that notwithstanding yes the plot was predictable i think perhaps if jill had slept with richard then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was which would have added more to the suspense it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about richards little problem with his exwife maybe a bit more back story i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie i would have liked to have seen more closure with zacks death and possibly closure with her husband i do have to say though i will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture her standing there it was a very fitting end for richard of course mitzi rocked i am so looking forward to her future projects
i watch most movies that nick mancuso is in because frankly i love the guy even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie longtime fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick its a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot but then most movies these days arent exactly original but rick roberts is appealing as the imperfect husband martha macisaac is equally appealing as the daughter and mitzi kapture does a good job if that was her goal of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis however too much of the plot takes place offscreen  like motivation prior behaviors good times and bad times  and things that seem apparent to the characters never quite make it to the audience ie me the final scene leaves everything to be desired in the but what about category and overall i cant say that i cared much about any of the characters that being said it was what it was  a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon  and i still like nick
this film starts out with a family who were all going in different directions and their teenage daughter martha macissac olivia dunne was very much in love with joe macleodzack the mother is played by mitzi kapturejill dunne who suddenly walks in on her daughter and zack making out and then all kinds of problems seem to surface jill dunne has a husband who is always traveling or staying away from the home quite often there are also big problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip which their daughter olivia dislikes and just cannot adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out all the bugs in many ways olivia does an outstanding performance as the teenage and nick mancusorichard grant gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner this film will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a film filled with plenty of horror and terror enjoy
when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay speaking of gameplay the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you
not being a fan of first person shooters i was very hesitant to play this game after having played the demo however i was sold undying really manages to pull you in the game and be part of the universe that your character is in you have this green amuletcalled the gelziabar stone that has special powers and warns you of particular events or things to look at with a special spell the scrye you can see certain things that otherwise would be invisible to you walking in a hallway you suddenly hear the magical stone whisper lookwith the stone glowing at for example a painting and then using the scrye spell you can see some weird and creepy stuff on the painting let me tell you to witness something like that is scary as hell people who expect to finish this game in a few hours can forget about that even with the use of cheats this game relies on the character using wits and walking carefully around because like in any horror movie your surroundings are usually pretty dark and ghosts and monster appear at random when you dont expect them and can kill you very quickly there is this one scene where you want to enter a room where you are pushed back with such great force that it takes moments for you to realize what happened this was a scene that could have come straight out of the horror classic evil dead to experience something like this is a real accomplishment there are a lot of elements that take undying to the level of the best classic horror movies ever produced but sadly i have to report that there are some flaws for one thing the universe you are playing in is huge you start out in a big mansion with all sorts of hiddensecret rooms and even a hidden hell dimension called oneiros that is all fine in the beginning but with all the loading times and some difficult enemies in between that can become frustrating and there is no map the game demands you memorize your surroundings so patience is required also there are some jumping puzzles that you have to do otherwise you cant progress i dont mind jumping on platforms in third person adventures but in first person mode that can be an annoying task luckily you can save at anytime and anyplace and trust me you will need it overall undying is an extraordinary first person shooter that deserves to be played by any horror or game fan
i gotta say clive barkers undying is by far the best horror game to have ever been made ive played resident evil silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements barker is good at what he does which is attach the horror to our world and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game heck even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title i just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor pc sales nipped that one in the bud
i love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it the way that the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit its very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that its just a game and your not really there the sound effects and audio are amazing there are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not you get this stone that can knock back enemies while you recover mana to blast your foes with even more magic the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you if you want to get the full experience try playing it with head phones on
emilio miraglios the red queen kills seven times 1972 is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that i have ever seen mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed first of all and of paramount importance for me it has a complex twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end the story concerning a series of gruesome murders you already know how many from the films title right that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters is an involving one and the murderer a redcloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman is both frightening and memorable every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses and here we have quite an assortment headed by the ridiculously beautiful barbara bouchet as one of the two sisters and in one of her earlier roles sybil danning as a lustful tramp at barbaras fashion house another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy hummable score and bruno nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days gorgeous scenery check again filmed largely in wurzburg germany the picture is a treat for the eye indeed ok ok but what about those murders after all isnt that what gialli are all about well im pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings shootings impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes outnot to mention the crypts freaky dream sequence rats and bats and lots of em too the drug references a rape scene the obligatory red herrings and in the person of ugo pagliai a hunky leading man for the female viewers as i said a perfect giallo and even better this dvd is from the fine folks at no shame and you know what that means a gorgeous print and loads of extras to boot thanks guys
undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups it tells the story of patrick galloway an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in ireland to investigate some weird phainomena the game is set in ireland after world war one so dont expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchersall the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate onour hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the leftso you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game the graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power pclevel design is also cool and atmospheric mostly the game revolves around the covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress thanks to the talent of clyve barker the game has an excelent storyline and plot something very rare for a first person shooter and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent but the game has two main flaws first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of explorationsecondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry as far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not frustratingly difficult overall undying is a great game definitely one of the best fps out there
this game was really great and quite a challenge it has a great spooky story line and the graphics are also very good i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just mebr br  a truly great game for rpg and shootemup fansbr br 
this is undeniably the scariest game ive ever played its not the average shooteverythingthatmoves kind of fps which i usually dont care much for but the acceptable gfx interesting weapons and magic great surround soundeffects scryeeee scryeeee and above all incredible atmosphere i love the scrye which enables you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past the only game ive had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere im a great horror fan escpecially of clive barkers stories and movies and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story 910 1 because im no fps fan and perhaps the game was a bit short
the days is a typical family drama with a little catch  you must relate to the characters emotions in every way possible in order for you to truly appreciate the showbr br possible spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the showbr br the story obviously for all the people who has watched the show is the world of cooper day the middle child of the family he records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his observations his family includes a mother a father a perfect sister and a geniuslittlebrother the first episode which is going to sound a bit stupid since john scott shepard has created this situation  both the sister and mother gets pregnant thats the first situation the writer hits then the father quits his job at the law firm the youngest son gets a panic attack the middle child gets in a fight with the sisters boyfriend this is all in a days workbr br spoilersbr br i admire this show i dont know its a bit crappy but i like it first i thought the camerawork was a ripoff but then i got used it and started to like it i liked the quiet conversations under a dark light i liked the intimate feeling of the show i liked the lowbudget style i liked the acting i admire the story then i find myself wanting a second season of the days i slowly became a fan of it as the 6episode airing on abc came to an end its a really good show and its nothing like the oc the two have nothing in common so i hope fans will stop comparing thembr br and if you can relate to either abby jack natalie cooper or even nate youll like this show a lot
the one and only season has just aired here in australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant i love it all the story lines are so good and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other their problems were real and it really drew you into the show the show is basically about this family called the days and their lives the family consisted of abby day mum jack day dad natalie day sporty daughter cooper day outsider son and nathan day boy genius son each episodes a day of their life with coopers perspective on things throughout it i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great he was by far my favorite character it ended with so many things it couldve continued with im really sad another season wasnt made it was a great show im gonna miss it
i would just like to say that no matter how low budget the film is it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies we dont read that much anymore instead people want to see movies having this series out on dvd has made me want to read the whole series and want more please make all 8 movies please dont change any of the characters either it ruins the effect because i have grown to love the actors who have played the characters please make all 8 movies i want to see the message and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray we dont get that enough anymore awesome job

this movie was so great i am a teenager and i and my friends all love the series so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds i recommend it to everyone my favorite line in this movie is when logan bartholomew says rosy cheeks when he is talking about his baby daughter he is such a great actor as well as erin cottrell they pair up so well and have such a great chemistry i really hope that they can work again together they are such attractive people and are very good actors i have finally found movies that are good to watch lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good and show good morals and christian values but at the same time these movies arent cheesy
i love all of the movies by michael landon jr and michael landon jrs casting of dale midkiff as clark daviscould not of been any better dale midkiff has the ways to pull off this characterbr br this movie kept me spellbound from start to finishbr br the death of missie  willies baby girl with the timing of clarks visit was only gods timing how they dealt with the death and how clark helped them do so was that of a fathers lovebr br although there are 3 movies before this one  love comes softly  loves enduring promise  loves long journey i feel you can see this movie and understand it easily yet leave and want to see the previous 3 movies due to the history all the characters have behind thembr br michael landon jr is an excellent directorbr br i look forward to many more movies from him in the future
and heres yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror emilio miraglias the red queen kills seven times is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting stylish production values enchanting music great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences its a fabulous giallo released in the golden year 1972 that belongs in the topfive of every fan of italian cinema the storyline doesnt just introduce your average blackgloved  sexually frustrated killer but blends good oldfashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous red queen at young age their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings kitty and evelyn about an uncanny lady who once every 100 years on april 6th kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim fourteen years later kitty has become the successful choreographer of a prominent modeling agency even sharing her bed with the general manager when suddenly the killing spree begins sister evelyn would be the obvious culprit but she moved to the states recently or has she complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the red queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallohistory her face can never be seen but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim shes not exactly gentle either as her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger dragged behind cars and even impaled on fences that latter one is truly one of the greatest  most gruesome acts of violence ive ever seen what more could you possibly request some classy and tasteful nudity perhaps the gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered among them barbara bouchet and a young sybil danning emilio miraglia isnt the most famous giallodirector as he only made this one and the equally recommended the night evelyn came out of the grave but his influence and importance should not be forgotten
edmund burke said that all evil needs is for good me to do nothing hollywood often gives us trash because not enough families go to see quality films this movie was uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith it had no violence no lewdness and did not deserve a pg rating the western scenery was filmed well and some of the vistas were simply breathtaking actors were a bit young for their parts but otherwise believable and talented music score was too loud and in some places drowned out the dialog completely im seldom surprised by movie endings any more but i was pleasantly surprised by this one sometimes the good guys do win and they win by honest efforts we liked the movie and the message and would recommend it for the entire family
zombie chronicles isnt something to shout about its obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining bmovie directed by brad sykes who directed camp blood which was another entertaining low budget flick the acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but thats what makes it more entertaining the zombie makeup is cool and effective especially with the budget the gore is also great and gross the film is sort of like a zombie version of tales from the crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale zombie chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget bmovies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out zombie chronicles
okay first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free first  this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3d it is for the most part but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2d what its not that hard to film in a car second  the story isnt very good there are a lot of things wrong with itbr br third  why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed watch it for a good laugh  but dont waste your time buying it just download it or something for cheap
what could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women theyre supposed to be spying on and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banalbr br but the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense you can see real people behind the unreal lines and the directing is wonderful each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too longbr br i showed this to several friends in the mid80s because i was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie the friends enjoyed it too
a critical and financial flop when first release the critics have turned around and stated that this film ison of the directors best a la ronde like feel to the film quickly develops as the guys from a detective agency ben gazzara john ritter and blaine novak persue fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky and beautiful women seen on film audrey hepburn colleen camp dorothy stratten and patti hansen much of the script was adlibbed or rewritten on the day of shooting which gives the film a breezy feel ben gazzara is excellent as the head detective persuing audrey hepburn after dropping singer colleen camp and seeing cabdriver patti hansen on the side john ritter ineptly follows dorothy stratten and immediately falls in love with her blaine novak has a few girls he is chasing including joyce hyser and elizabeth pena this film has some great performances by a supurb cast standouts are audrey hepburn she doesnt have a line in the first half of the film ben gazzara has never been better and an inspiring choice for a romantic lead and colleen camp has one of her best roles as the manic country singer christy miller she is a delight to watch as she fires off her lines in a ratatattat delivery highly recommended  stars
bogdonovichs mostly unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other a film that has the feel of a fairy tale but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic manhattan locations and true geography perhaps the best location filming in nyc ive ever seen john ritter reminds us that with good directors bogdanovich blake edwards billy bob he can be brilliant and the entire ensemble is a group youll wish truly existed so you could spend time with em one of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesnt seem to be a ripoff of something else this is the high point of bogdanovichs fertile after success career when his best work was truly done saint jack at long last noises off
sublimity is the way we have to reach for the beauty and sublimity is the stuff this film is made of if not his best its my most loved of all bogdanovich moviesbr br this unique masterpiece remind us as most of the other films from the director what life is or should be about love lost or failure and hope and faith and charity as the song from whom the films takes its title gershwins well known composition the film makes the impossible true and tries to make us aware that noone is able to judge anybody all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction the first ten minutes with the detectives following the ladies almost without a line of dialogue constructed upon the looks and views of the characters with that bogdanovich touch based on the pointofview is a class on cinema language something that pb learned well from his admired directors from the golden age of the movies with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack including the best of sinatras trilogy this movie full of selfconsciousness and compassion and far away from selfindulgence and emptiness as some critics wrote deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed its not long on style short on substance it is complex in its simplicity and beautiful absolutely beautiful
i am glad other people enjoyed this movie cause i know it doesnt have the greatest reputation and it made no money at the box office i thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why  bogdanovich directs with the lightest of touches the cast especially coleen camp is perfect and the big bad apple never looked better on film youve seen worse movies
new york has never looked so good and neither has anyone in this movie while the script is a bit lightweight you cant help but like this movie or any of the characters in it you almost wish people like this really existed the appeal of the actors are what really put it overjohn ritter colleen camp and the late dorothy stratten are particularly good go ahead and rent or buy this movie youll be glad you did
peter bogdonavich has made a handful of truly great films and they all laughed is one of his best the cast couldnt be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy interestingly enough the witty light touch bogdonavich so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather disarming emotional core fresh and immediate the film starts with absolutely no explanation theres no soundtrack music to cue us we meet the characters in action and as bogdonavich glides down the streets of new york the film unfolds effortlessly robby mullers camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental but surely isnt the cast is terrific in every way a classic
there are some films that every horror fan owes himself or herself to see and emilio miraglias la dama rossa uccide sette volte aka the red queen kills seven times 1972 is definitely one of them with gialli and gothic tales being my two favorite subgenres in horror i was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while and even though my expectations were high this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes miraglias earlier giallo the night evelyn came out of the grave 1971 was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed giallo with gothic horror but it couldnt possibly compare to this instant personal favorite the red queen kills seven times is hands down one of the most unique and overwhelming italian horror films ever made and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it an incredibly mesmerizing giallo with strong gothic elements the red queen delivers everything one could hope for in either subgenre an inventive and incredibly compelling plot spinechilling suspense a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere eerily lush colors stylish murders a brilliant score and not least a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful barbara bouchet  this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terrorbr br the film starts out incredibly in a beautiful gothic castle in germany as little girls kitty wildenbrück and her sister evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting legend has it that a fiendish red lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people fourteen years later kitty barbara bouchet has become a successful fashion photographer suddenly people begin to get murdered director miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style atmosphere and colorful creepiness with the night evelyn came out of the grave and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem the red queen kills seven times is a feast for the eyes indeed and one of the most overwhelming italian horror films both visually and plotwise the haunting painting in the grandfathers castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps the red lady or red queen as she is called in the english title is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a giallo the spinechilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own br br a sexy female cast is always appreciated especially in a giallo and this one is a prime example for that the ravishing barbara bouchet one of my favorite actresses must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen and she is a great actress too bouchets presence has graded up many italian flicks among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest cultmasterpieces of italian 70s cinema within one year 1972 fernando di leos milano calibro 9 lucio fulcis giallohighlight dont torture a duckling and this unforgettable gem apart from the wonderful miss bouchet the films gorgeous female cast includes sexy young sybil danning marina malfatti the night evelyn came out of the grave and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera br br as the whole film the murders are stylish and extremely elegant yet frightening and macabre and some of them are quite gory bruno nicolais mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets and makes the films intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting the plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings the tensionlevel increses with each passing minute the red queen begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second overall this is one of the films that i cannot find enough words of praise for the red queen kills seven times is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest gialli ever made and a toppriority for every fan of horror andor italian cinema to see 1010
bromwell high is nothing short of brilliant expertly scripted and perfectly delivered this searing parody of a students and teachers at a south london public school leaves you literally rolling with laughter its vulgar provocative witty and sharp the characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of british society or to be more accurate of any society following the escapades of keisha latrina and natella our three protagonists for want of a better term the show doesnt shy away from parodying every imaginable subject political correctness flies out the window in every episode if you enjoy shows that arent afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable then bromwell high will not disappoint
with various bogdanoviches and gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew they all laughed is very much a family affairif you add the fact that bgazzara and miss ahepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary considerationif this all smacks of smug in  joke self gratification you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent i love ny paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late miss hepburn make no mistake this is her picturemr gazzara concedes it to her most self  effacingly in all their scenes together the plot  a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients affairs  is of minimal importanceit is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie mr bogdanovichs triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actorsfrom targets onwardsthere is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipmentmiss hepburn in particular benefits from this love extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directorsprincipally who the hells in it recently remaindered in uk bookstores the soundtrack to they all laughed varies from louis armstrongs 1947 new york town hall concert to sinatra to country to latinas eclectic as the city it portrays mr bs golden boy image was sure to tarnishfor such is the nature of the movie businessbut it is equally sure one day to be restoredand when that day comes they all laughed will be recognised for the fine work that it is
they all laughed is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that its set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben gazzara and the late john ritter who is superb and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novakthe films coproducer and john ritter basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnates wifehepburn and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans
this movie is perfect for all the romantics in the world john ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie sam hits close to home is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with ben gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with im sure ive met arthur in my travels somewhere all around an excellent choice to pick up any evening
since the day i saw this film when it came out in 1981 it has been one of my top 3 favorites the blurb i wrote for amazon is below and im just thrilled that its finally coming out on dvd on 101706  the films 25th anniversarybr br the last credit in this film explains its appeal  thank you to the people of manhattan on whose island this was filmed a charming and witty romantic comedy it is a love story written to new yorkers peter bogdanovich is a native who can identify every location west 12th street the ansonia the old fao schwartz the plaza the roxy chez brigitte and city limits which was a country  western club one gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well offscreen as they do on and this intimacy is clearly communicated i laughed i cried it was better than cats not only an ode to dorothy stratten it was also audrey hepburns last feature appearance she had a cameo subsequent to this film and her inner beauty seeps from the screen buy it make a big tub of popcorn and curl up with someone you love
i watched it some years ago i remembered it as very mysterious situations and a mixture of melancholic things like the fate of dorothy and the personal future of bogdanovichbr br i turn to watch on my vhs copy and then i was reviewing it more and more nowadays i am waiting for the dvd version at any price pleasebr br the country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the very first second a bit of blueish but also happybr br all the characters are great to me with funny situations great acting and a lot of dialogs that have turn this as a cult movie to me and a lot of people i met on the internet or cinema clubs this may not be casualtybr br i think that the title is a hope about life you have to be happy and laugh as much as possiblebr br i know that this may be a particular comment for the movie but the fact is that i like it very much i think that movie marked me and i will never forget it
screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in new york city peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picturehe reveres themyet audrey hepburn is naturally put a notch above the others because after all shes the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior he shoots her in loving closeups gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hardboiledsoftboiled ben gazzara and allows her room to sparkle throughout the loveconnections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing though i did tire of john ritters tvstyled klutziness colleen camp dorothy stratten and the grounded earthysensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch but its really hepburns valentine and she absolutely glows  from 
well i had seen they all laughed when it came out inbr br europe around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it i ve just seen it again on tape almost twenty years after bogdanovich has a true heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not to feel also excellent comedians and actors good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing too i laughed and smiled all the time just as we all do at times go get it
they all laughed is one of those little movies i am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary it is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past but seems more contemporary even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesnt date it too much bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet that reality never brings it crashing down to earth but that said this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going and tal is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale it is a movie that wouldnt linger so long in the memory if it werent for the little moments provided by the excellent cast colleen camps simultaneously shouting orders at john ritter and her dog blaine novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat and especially the moment dorothy stratten falls for john ritter and says howweird its such a piece of fluff one doesnt want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on ones face
first of all this was not a three hour movie  two hours ten minutes last time i checked commercials arent actually part of a movie perhaps though it shouldve been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen because of this movie i do now but im not so sure thats a good thing everything here no one really needed to know this was essentially a movie that didnt need to be made but it was made and the reason is because lucy  desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars that is definitely so not true and very very sadbr br anyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good two complaints  the actress who played viv vance  not great casting at all and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york uhhh like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden shes a whole new person that wasnt too great but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy  desi no the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasnt necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy  desi had there been more time had the story been more about lucys entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more but they werent so we got to see the likes of gable  lombard red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in lucys life really neat and its too bad that wasnt explored more oh well what was explored was done well for the most part honestly i dont think ill ever watch this again and i dont think this moviell be that memorable for someone who digs i love lucy but isnt an enormous lucille ball fan this should be an interesting watch my grade for this b
before i watched this tv movie i did not know much about one of my favorite actresses after watching it i realized how sad lucille balls life really was it had its great moments too but i didnt realize how sad it was this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well i highly reccommend it
an old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he foretoldbr br people are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyedbr br kitty barbara bouchet is the suspect but we know she is not the killer is it franziska marina malfatti is it evelyn back from death for revenge is it a plot to steal an inheritance the color is superb in this thriller from emilio miraglia who only did one other giallo as far as i knowbr br the only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out someone calls the police and suddenly they are there trying to save kitty
dramatic license  some hate it though it is necessary in retelling any life story in the case of lucy the main points of lucille balls teenage years early career and 20 year marriage to desi arnaz are all included albeit in a truncated and reworked waybr br the main emotional points of lucys life are made clear lucilles struggle to find her niche as an actress finally blossoming into the brilliant comedienne who made the character lucy ricardo a legend her turbulent romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to desi arnaz lucy  desi creating the first television empire and forever securing their place in history as tvs most memorable sitcom couplebr br as lucille ball rachel york does a commendable job do not expect to see quite the same miraculous transformation like the one judy davis made when playing judy garland but york makes ball strongwilled yet likable and is very funny in her own right even though her comedictiming is different than lucys she is still believable the film never goes into much detail about her perfectionistic behaviour on the set and her mistreatment of vivian vance during the early i love lucy years but watching york portray lucy rehearsing privately is a nice inclusionbr br daniel pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real desi was but he does have his own charm and does a mostly decent job with desis accent especially in the opening scene madeline zima was decent if not overly memorable as the teenaged lucybr br vivian vance and william frawley were not featured much thankfully since rebecca hobbs and russell newman were not very convincing in the roles not that they arent good actors in their own right they just were not all that suited to the people they were playing most of the actors were from austrailia and new zeland and the repressed accents are detectable at timesbr br although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact there are many deviations some for seemingly inexplicable reasons jess oppenheimer the head writer of lucys radio show my favourite husband which began in 1948 is depicted in this film as arriving on the scene to help with i love lucy in 1951 completely disregarding the fact that he was the main creator this movie also depicts marc daniels as being the main i love lucy director for its entire run completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by william asher after the first season also though i figure this was due to budgetary constraints the ricardos are shown to live in the same apartment for their entire stay in new york when in reality they changed apartments in 1953 the kitchen set is slightly larger and offscale from the original as well the connecticut home looks pretty close to the original except the right and left sides of the house have been condensed and restructured br br theres also desi talking about buying rko in 1953 during lucys redscare incident even though rko did not hit the market until 1957 these changes well could have been for dramatic license and the film does work at conveying the main facts but would it have hurt them to show a bit more respect to oppenheimer and asher two vital figures in i love lucy history the biggest gaff comes in the i love lucy recreation scenes at least a few of them its always risky recreating something that is captured on film and has been seen by billions of people but even more so when obvious changes are made the scene with the giant bread loaf was truncated and anyone at all familiar with that episode would have noticed the differences right away the were having a baby number was shortened as well but other than that it was practically dead on by far the best was the grapestomping scene with rachel york really nailing lucys mannerisms the producers made the wise decision not to attempt directly recreating the vitametavegamin and candy factory bits instead showing the actors rehearse them these scenes proved effective because of that approachbr br the films main fault is that it makes the assumption the viewers already know a great deal about lucys life since much is skimmed over or omitted at all overall though it gives a decent portrait of lucy  desis marriage and the factual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively
i thought rachel york was fantastic as lucy i have seen her in kiss me kate and victorvictoria as well and in each of these performances she has developed very different and very real characterizations she is a chameleon who can play and sing anythingbr br i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachels performance in lucy even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesnt really look like lucy my response to that is so what i wasnt looking for a superficial impersonation of lucy i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown and rachel certainly gave us that in great depth i also didnt want to see someone simply doing classic lucy routines therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits  vitameatavegamin and the candy factory it seems that some of the reviewers didnt realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits this approach i thought gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart i also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated  the professor and the grape stomping in particular there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachels mouth had the exact little upturn that i remember lucy having i couldnt believe she was able to capture that  and so naturallybr br i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of i love lucy throughout the entire movie after all those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge given the right set of circumstances lucy didnt fit the mold of the old studio system in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate giftsbr br i believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy drama wit sadness anger passion love ambition loyalty sexiness self absorption childishness and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing lucy was a star turn for rachel york i hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future i also hope it brings her an emmy

i am black american and i loved this soap opera i watched it dubbed in spanish on telemundo almost 57 years ago the story was a true story about a black slave whos love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid whimsical way of livingbr br a lot of us could learn a lot from xica she took what she had nothing and saw her possibilities many would argue that she sold herself out  but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future childrenbr br it was such an excellent soap opera that i thought it would be released on dvd but its not being released this soap opera was the best soap opera ever we need for it to be released on dvd or broadcast on tv again its playing on azteca america right now which is only available in mexico or in the us by paid cable we need it released again to telemundo
this show is a great history story its has everything from slaverythe way they were treated religion the ways jews were sent into hidingthe inquisition the belief in the orisha the african gods the way women were treatedincluding the daughters even down to homosexuality the way the characters are intertwined and that violante that character saddens me she is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around heri am so glad they decided to rerelease it to tv again although i would love to see the unedited version xica has become my heroine i look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it i love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century i look forward to my xica every night it would be great to dub it in english so the americans can love her too
i absolutely loved this soap it has been one of my favorite will highly recommend  i just love brazilian soaps they deal with real life events im really sad that the soap ended but im sure ill be able to find it somewhere for those of you who have not seen it please see it i loved the characters the plot and how things turned out in the end for the villains the only thing i would have changed is the end for xica and her long life love i cant wait to see it again and highly recommend it xica has been by far the best soap i have ever seen forget everything else go xica hope you all like it as well
xica da silva is one of the best brazilians opera soap ever the a black slaves story that becomes queen of a small villa when conquering the most powerful mans of the area love in the colonial period of the brazil dominated by portugal that explored its diamonds the largest xica enemy violante bride that it was changed by xica is a woman of big it influences the portugal king close to and does to take revenge of the slave of everything very religious person she is a picture of the hypocritical society and religious of the time she dedicates its life the morality of the villa that was committed by xica that is a woman full of lusts that it faces the society of the time to preach and it helps the slaves of the area the story also bill with forbidden loves sorceries and vampires and religious fervor xica da silva does with that you dont want to lose a i only surrender from beginning to end
telemundo should definitely consider making a dvd collection of the novela xica i know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela xica it is a very entertaining novela which is set in brazil the costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful xica contains a lot of history of that time period i wish telemundo would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning i would highly recommend watching xica if it is ever shown again on telemundo ive emailed telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears the only cautionary statement about xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore i would recommend that children under 14 do not watch xica overall xica merits a 10 out of 10
this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made it is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what exactlys going on the film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers commercials contests one enters by mail and a host of other innovations besides what other movies have cameos by martin luther king jr to decipher the film hunt down the directors book entitled i was curious itll all become clear its a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking a triumph now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color other than whitethe white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible
wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary

i am curious yellow a film in near seussical rhyme is said right at the start to be available in two versions yellow and blue was one of those big arthouse hits that first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandalcausecelebre in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court whats potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of whats revealed in the sex or nudity the directoractor vilgot sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but its always moreso an intellectual expression than very lustlike but the daring of the attempt at a pure metafilm while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in sweden who knew such things in a generally peaceful country ie usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars could be so heatedup politically at least thats part of sjomans aim here br br like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like wr if not as surreal and deranged or to a slightly lesser extent bertolucci sjoman is out to mix politics and sex mostly politics and social strata around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film the two characters lena and borje have a hotcold relationship in the story of the film where lena is a curious socialistwannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and trains sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend and as this is going on which is by itself enough for one movie sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film theres even a great bit midway through where as if at a rock concert title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are negating having to use end credits then with this theres a whole other dynamic as sjoman gives an actual performance not just a hey im the director playing the director bitbr br at first one might not get this structure and that i am curious yellow is just a film where lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class socialism spain and franco and once in a while we see lenas father or bjore but sjoman does something interesting the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes its impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative documentary filmwithinafilm and even a serious interview with martin luther king who also acts as a quasiguru for lena it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically but it doesnt feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture the satire sjoman is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other wavelength his anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewerbr br if i am curious yellow stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a fullblown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors it isnt entirely successful i think as an emotional experience where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors occasionally it works if only for the actors lena nyman mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even and borje ahlstedt a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile lena but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the innerfilm of lena and borje since perhaps intentionally sjoman fills it up with clichés borje has a girlfriend and kid will he leave her how will lena reconcile her father and a heavyhanded narration from his starlet of sortsbr br and yet for whatever faults sjoman may have ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself i am curious yellow holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema or testing what couldnt be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage id even go as far as to say its influential and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time a specific technique used with the film rewinding towards the end is echoed in poorer usage in funny games and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avantgarde or metafilmmaking if its not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as wr or last tango its close behind
i dont know how or why this film has a meager rating on imdb this film accompanied by i am curious blue is a masterworkbr br the only thing that will let you down in this film is if you dont like the process of film dont like psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic rammingbr br this isnt a film that you will want to watch to unwind its a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece with time attention and carebr br summaries may contain a spoiler or twobr br the main thing about this film is that it blends the whole film within a film thing but it does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that the fictions arent realbr br the film is like many films in onebr br 1 a political documentary about the social system in sweden at the time which in a lot of ways are still relevant to today interviews done by a young woman named lenabr br 2 a narrative about a filmmaker vilgot sjoman making a film he deals with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should have never got involved with people hes supposed to work withbr br 3 the film that vilgot is making its about a young woman named lenaie 2 who is young and very politically active she is making a documentary ie 1 she is also a coming of age and into her sexuality and the freedom of thatbr br the magnificence and sheer brilliance of i am curious yellowblue is how these three elements are cut together in one moment you are watching an interview about politics and the next your watching what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes but does that so well that you sometimes forget that it is the narrativebr br another thing is the dynamic between yellow and blue which if you see one you must see the other blue is not a sequel at all ill try to explain it best i can because to my knowledge no other films have done it though it is a great techniquebr br think of yellow as a living thing actual events in 14 scenes a complete talebr br think of blue as all the things in between the 14 scenes in yellow that you didnt see that is a complete tale on its ownbr br essentially they are parallel films the same story told in two different waysbr br it wasnt until i saw the first 30 minutes of blue that i fully understood yellowbr br i hope this was helpful for people who are being discouraged by various influences because this film changed the way i looked at filmbr br thanks for your time
this movie is not porn it was not meant to be porn and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered pornbr br now that that issue was sorted out i can say i thoroughly recommend this film as its issues are still widely available its funny the acting is great and it raises seriouscurious questionsbr br i cant fully understand why this film was so mistreated probably this is why i plan to never visit the us lena is the true pioneer of the modern riotgrrrl movement confusion curiosity and wit are her main attributes she is occasionally angry but arent we all
this is truly an excellent film with a revolutionary message both in form and content that should not be missed by any fan of french new wave or underground film there are barely opening or closing creditswe are just dropped into the world of consumerist art revolution and youth this film has little to do with documentary and is more interesting in playing with our ideas of advertising and its relationship to reality lines of real and not real are crossed in ways familiar with films discussing documentary but this time we do it for the sake of consuming and marketing not for describing the real
i didnt expect to like this film as much as i did i got it simply because i saw it on the list of top 25 most controversial films of all time it didnt look particularly great i was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most cleverly composed films of recent memorybr br its about a twentyyearold woman wants to know everything she stores every bit of information she collects in an enormous archive she experiments with experience in sex political activism and human relationships meanwhile films crew is shown making the film and we view their reactions to the story and each other nudity explicit sex and controversial politics kept this film from being shown in the us while its seizure by customs was appealed the film is a narrative yet its a documentary that shows us the behindthe scenes world of the filmmakers during the narrative the fourth wall being broken this film is the most direct possible way of making a movie i have ever seen the movie predominantly works as a time capsule of 1960s psychedelic goingson freedomfighting and sexual liberation i like to think of it as much more than thatbr br i didnt think i would want to waste my time with the blue version of this movie but i actually really do this film is a buried treasure give it a try
this is a great film  esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of todays politicallyminded filmmakers a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days while the bouyant optimism of the 1960s cant be regained i think we can at least learn a lesson from the films breezy energy and charm i dont know what those who label the film boring were watching  theres so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that 15 min at a time
jag är nyfiken  yellow is a lot of fun like at least one other reviewer i was on numerous occasions laughing out loud yellow is energetic playful selfaware explorative dont expect bergman here this movie is about a youth in the early to mid60s in sweden and about the issues read contradictions that the nation and the world were facing at times yellow appears to be an earnest socialpolitical documentary with lena the main character and others interviewing both common people and politicians eg olaf palme at home at other times yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary all the while yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring lenas life  her home life her loves her political views her view of herself she is a complete person  complex flawed contradictory happy sad curious and placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director sjöman and his crew documenting themselves documenting lena it is this that for me really gives yellow wings not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice but their presence is itself another layer of the film they are filming themselves filming themselves i am reminded of a bjork music video with this same quality  a music video about the making of a music video ad infinitum with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish i think sjöman may have had something similar in mind while jag är nyfiken  yellow may not be everyones cup of tea it is certainly intelligent witty refreshing ebullient and authentic

fascinating i approached i am curious yellow and its companion piece with great trepidation id read numerous reports on its widely touted controversy and explicit sex what i got wasnt this but a thoroughly thought provoking and engaging cinema experience unlike any other i sincerely believe that the majority of the commenter who felt the film was lame or boring approached the film as if it were pornography perhaps this is pornography assuming pornography is something intended to titillate the senses but it is intentionally unerotic lena the protagonist throws her all into her performance giving it a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and enduring her breasts may be saggy her nipples unusually large her thighs fat and her face chubby but by the end of the film the audience comes to identify with her and accept her faults as human this touch gives her even more believability out necessity had the director cast a briget bardot bombshell the effect would have been nullified i cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece be prepared to invest much thought in this deliberately paced film the patient and unassuming viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in ways most other films could dream
of all the versions of the odyssey or of any greek mythological story for that matter this in my opinion is the best of them all almost true to the original storyline  with some minor deviations and omissions eg the absence of scylla  charybdis and the fact that eumaeus the swineherd recognizes odysseus in disguise in his hut  realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiecenot some hollywoodish swordandsandal bflick notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in italian if one is familiar with the storyline he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying provided you have a good handy text of the odyssey at hand at least i did and so much so that it has inspired me to study the italian language to better appreciate the movie even more
emilio miraglias first giallo feature the night evelyn came out of the grave was a great combination of giallo and gothic horror  and this second film is even better weve got more of the giallo side of the equation this time around although miraglia doesnt lose the gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around and as a result its the typical giallo labyrinth with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes this is a definite bonus for the film however as while it can get a little too confusing at times theres always enough to hold the audiences interest and miraglias storytelling has improved since his earlier movie the plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle the legend revolves around a woman called the red queen who legend has it returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people a few years later murders begin to occurbr br even though he only made two giallos miraglia does have his own set of tributes its obvious that the colour red is important to him as it features heavily in both films and he appears to have something against women called evelyn he likes castles gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too  which is fine by me miraglia may be no argento when it comes to spilling blood but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film and here we have delights involving a volkswagen beetle and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes the female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning barbara bouchet and marina malfatti heading up an eyepleasing cast of ladies that arent afraid to take their clothes off the score courtesy of bruno nicolai is catchy and even though it doesnt feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in the night evelyn came out of the grave it fits the film well the ending is something of a turnoff as although miraglia revs up the gothic atmosphere it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious but even so this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that i highly recommend to fans of the genre
im italian and when ive recently looked again this film i astonished for its beauty the first time i was 10 years old and i liked it but today i can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings now i can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the italian cinema pasolini etc by that time gone br br the hollywood epic films are goodfor fun perhaps this odyssey had no english version because is not enough funny not suitable for popcorn and coke audience however suitable for homer pathos and existentialist reflectionsbr br in italy was recently released a very good dvd version integral with excellent colors you can find it in some file sharing but its italian only and without subtitles too bad also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable
this movie of 370 minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations told at list 500 years after those events toke place around 1100 bcbr br this is a 1969 movie so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian even the close caption is in italian pity many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie
although i have not seen this miniseries in over twenty years i can still remember how the balance between characterplot and tale of marvelous adventures succeeded the use of special effects was restrained making a more poetic rather than literal telling of the story the two versions ive seen were dubbed english and frenchbut the actors appear to speak their own language not just italian so there is a synchronization problem it does not spoil the story telling among the cast irene pappas as penelope is the most recognizable to north americans recommended to all followers of odysseus ever returning
in all honesty this series is as much a classic as television goes as the original poem is to the worlds literature far from being crassly exploitative it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western cultures defining textsbr br i was moved by the plight of odysseus and his followers touched by the drama of the fall of troy which was felt but not seen intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals it should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous cgi creatures flitting around on their ankle wings or poorlycast fashion models in bikinis as in homers work they act through mortal agents or rarely are represented by classical statuarybr br its a pity its not available in dvd especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the odyssey that one can find in video stores
its very simple to qualify that movie a pure masterpiece this opinion is formulated for the following reasons the performance of the actors they seem to be citizens of that epoch 1100 bc they personalize perfectly the characters a second reason is that the poetry expressed by homere in his poem is well given by the production among others the narrations made by the chorus give a particular atmosphere that makes us party of the artistic rendition third reason the reconstitution of the decor is absolutely perfect in mediterranean regions where the action of the poem occurred and most of all the emotion is on the rendezvous i repeat my appreciation a pure masterpiece
ive been trying to find out about this series for ages thank you imdb i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind as a 6year old of course i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops which was absolutely chilling i talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine which i still have what i also remember though was the atmosphere which was unusual right from the beginning  mysterious austere and extremely authentic when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation its a very hard thing to capture  and probably impossible in hollywood every odyssey ive seen since has been an enormous letdown the characters in this series seemed genuine real people  ancient greek people  and not some hollywood stars in costumes this is a real masterpiece but  why is it not better known and why isnt it available on vhs or dvd i would just love to have the chance to see this again
as it was already put the best version ever of homers epic entirely shot in natural locations in the mediterranean the sea and the sky are strikingly blue the islands green and untouched the clothing is linen wool and fur the settings stony and bare everything is somewhat rugged and primitive a bit what you would find in cacoyannis or pasolini movies and it makes it all the more authentic although the story is based on myths and widely goes into supernatural it gives us a good idea of what life in the 10th century bc might have been likebr br the rhythm is somewhat slow and austere but the whole is so beautiful that you quickly get into it actually it is amazingly close to the original plot by homer if not to the text itself ulysses doesnt appear until the first hour the start being centered on his son looking after him then he suddenly appears lost in a storm lands on the island of the pheacians where the royal family takes good care of him his adventures are told in flashback as a narration to his hosts  the terrifying cyclop the magic world of circe the underworld the sirens etc he finally comes back to his homeland ithaca after 20 years and it all ends dramatically with the killing of the pretenders of his faithful spouse penelopebr br as a story the odyssey is an unparalleled metaphor of the struggles of a mans life the cast is brilliant and international here irene papas gives us a typical greek tragedy style performance as penelope but most amazing is the albanian actor bekim fehmiu as ulysses really good looking and totally convincing it seems the role was really made for him strange that he was never offered roles of this dimension afterwards also playing nausicaa is barbara bach as barbara gregorini later famous as the james bond girl in the spy who loved me and playing athena is michele breton who was otherwise noted in the strange movie called performance with mick jaggerbr br as it was done 35 years ago the series was actually quite an innovation for its time as the first big european coproduction for tv italy france germany and yugoslavia i have seen this miniseries in 8 parts on french television as far back as 1974 i was a kid back then and although it was all in black and white it left a very vivid impression all my life long i wondered if i would ever get a chance to see it again as it was never shown on french tv later onbr br i recently found a copy on dvd all in wonderful color through internet it is unfortunately only in italian with no subtitles although french and german versions existed back then i never heard there was any english version of this film as it is widely unknown in the anglo saxon world and its quite a shame if you ever get a chance to watch this you are not going to forget it everbr br there were not many versions of the odyssey before or after that the one by camerini in 1955 starring kirk douglas is a classic swordandsandal like the 10 commandments but not as impressive and very short for such a complex story the one in 1997 by konchalovsky is a meretricious hollywood movie based on special effects sometimes quite gory very poorly acted and grossly afar from homers story and atmosphere
documenting a documenter thats one way to describe keep the river on your right a modern cannibal tale this film follows anthropologist tobias schneebaum who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago first to west papua and then peru tobias is a fullbodied character a gay jewish artist anthropologist who eeks out a living on a cruise ship teaching gawking tourists about the cultures he has come to have a deep respect and understanding for author of several books documenting his time with both the asmat people of west papua and the cannibalistic amazonians in peru tobias has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become yet tobias constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch one can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselvesbr br tobias makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed this film challenges the notions of morality and naturalness eg nudity homosexuality cannibalism watch for the graphic circumcision scene when questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce his nonjudgmental nature asks why not who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong this little sleeper is a must watch for not only national geographic types but also those interested in the art of documentary making this film shows what can be done shot on video the editing provides a quiet revelation of tobias life that leaves you watching in fascination at times he despairs at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back especially considering his age and physical frailty we can be but grateful that tobias allowed the tables to be turned on himself perhaps sympathising with the desire to understand humanity and ones place in the world the filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance presenting for example one anthropologist who believes that tobias predetermined his findings of homosexuality in this case based on his personal interests that said you cant decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a cuddle move over river queen this is the best river ride ive taken in a while
i saw this film at amsterdams international documentary film festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and tobias schneebaum all of whom are lively and outspoken new yorkers the films title in amsterdam was keep the river on your right making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent equally important was the loving  and gay  relationship tobias schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist his reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leavetaking were very moving i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian
i read schneebaums book same title as this film when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of otherness his own and the people of the amazon with whom he lived and loved to a way of living a decent life his subsequent books were not as powerful but showed his continuing quest his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60s but his honesty and openness about it were welcome this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence which is not a morally positive term in this case that occurs when civilized men intrude on traditional societies even so schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness
this interesting giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory waysbr br directed by emilio p miraglia who one year earlier also made the very interesting la notte che evelyn usci della tomba see also my comment on that one the film starts off a little slow but all in all no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequencesbr br this film is a germanitalian coproduction but it was released in germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title horror house at least the murder scenes which will satisfy every gorehound are fully intact and the viewer still gets the killers motive at the end but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for of coursebr br a convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings la dama rossa uccide sette volte is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to miraglias above mentioned other thriller
i loved this movie when i saw it on febuary 3rd i knew i had to buy it it comes out to buy on july 24th it has cool deaths scenes hot girls great cast good story  good acting great slasher film the movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls see this movies
i really enjoyed this thriller i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over the cast was excellent the plot was suspenseful and entertaining and it was just an overall enjoyable movie i would rate this as one of the best thrillers ive ever seen the girls in it were really cute also especially denise richards she was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character some oomph
i gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes this is definitely really about a 55 ummm it was kind of bloody had likeable shallow characters and it had some really hot babes in it i like the eclectic killer because he didnt kill people the same way everytime that sometimes gets old
katherine heigl marley shelton denise richards david boreanaz even before i knew what this film was about these names were enough to draw me in gorgeous talented and popular these are performers to look out forbr br ok where do i start we already know what the film is about five beautiful girls being targeted by a romantic serial slasher a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago his trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards maggotinfested chocolates and a bleeding nose his weapon of choice well take a pick  axe knife electric powerdrill bow and arrow hot iron etc ok so basically its a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexualitybr br horror movies arent supposed to be shakespeare but im not gonna go there i love horror movies but not all of them this one i adore its up there with some of my other favorites its funny sexy and scary the killers mask is childishly creepy and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky the acting is topnotch denise richards marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun i really did wish to see much much more of katherine heigl i am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon jessica capshaw is a very capable actress and jessica cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in urban legend 2 the smaller parts were also good hedy buress was a hoot bleedmedrycom and that younger version of denise richards looked frightfully like herbr br highlights every death scene had a particular distinction to it the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue the hottub scene while ludicrous was well done and the audiovisual maze was sinister the soundtrack is great with creepy music and some fine alternative tunesbr br lowpoint i felt as though the killer wasnt featured enough we barely saw the mask and it wasnt featured at all during the climax i also thought the climax was really unfocused but fun nonethelessbr br the twist at the end wasnt that big of a surprise but im really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole explaining killer routinebr br i dont like to tell people which movies they should see but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing then valentine would be itbr br my rating 1010 bullseye
another entry in the holiday horror category that fills the shelves of your local video store the spoiler wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the cool kids who wronged him plot will of course be familiar to those whove watched it before and those whove seen it before will probably watch it again those who are expecting ingmar bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it marilyn manson on the soundtrack and david boreanaz denise richards and katherine heigl as eye candygo with the flow and enjoy it oh and i loved the creepy mask
the first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least however it improved afterwards as the valentine party commenced apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie the scene at the garden with kate was well shot and so was the very last scene the twist in those scenes there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty the way slashers should be edge to it the earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore
what an awesome movie it was very scary great acting wellwritten nice plot twists interesting characters very good direction and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face this is one popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to nonhorror fans but is still nonetheless one of the best thrillers out there today i highly recommend it to only fans ofbr br 1 the horror genrebr br orbr br 2 an actor or actress featured in itbr br  out of  starsbr br ps i am sick and tired of people comparing this and other modern horror movies with scream ya know what they didnt want to be like scream everyones like oh they copied scream well if i am not mistaking scream also copied other movies too in fact just about every horror movie copied an earlier one scream however was a good film but still stop comparing and enjoy it for what it isbr br go and rent this onebr br 
valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films the death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good marley shelton did great as the female lead much better than jennifer love hewitt in the i know films david boreanaz whom is the main reason i saw this movie had a pretty small role but he played it well the exception to the list of good actors is denise richards she was horrible in this the only scene i was glad to see her in was spoiler her death scene all in all its a good movie to watch you should definitely watch this before you watch scream or i know again
these slasher pics are past their sell by date but this one is good funbr br the valentine cards themselves are witty and well thought outbr br the film has one peach of a line hes no angel when he in fact is angel watching buffy reruns will never be the samebr br the cast is a sizzling display of young talent but the story does not give them enough real depth denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters sorry but nobr br the direction is very good managing to show very little actual gore and relying on your imaginations implied threat much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothesbr br essentially the main directorial plus lies within the borrowing of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks psychos shower scene is tributed along with halloweens masking br br murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i knowbr br light viewing not very scary but a few good jump moments if it was a choice between the hole and this though choose the hole slasher movies have had their day and this is just another slasher a very good slasher but nothing groundbreaking
call me stupid but i absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie valentine it was so wellmade wellwritten wellacted welldirected etc everything about it was wonderful there were parts that were relatively routine lilys death very funny wwwbleedmedrycom completely horrifying and creepy paiges death and just plain heartbreaking the first scene i think the entire cast did a great job especially the three leads david boreanaz denise richards both of whom i met and got autographs from during the filming of this movie  very nice people and marley sheltonbr br i am very sick of people calling this movie another scream clone this movie is in no way a scream clone in fact this film runs rings around scream it actually makes sense scream was also not the only movie to feature a masked killer in it excuse me but it looks like scream was also a clone too ahem friday the 13th halloween and many other scary movies also featured masked killers i also think that the novelty of the cupidmasked killer is brilliant its so strange to see a sweet cupid face doing all of these horrible things another novelty the nose bleeding makes way for a fantastic ending the ending gives me chills every time i see it so even if you didnt like it the first time watch valentine again and give it another chancebr br ps keep an eye out for my new website wwwlovehurtsorg coming soon
what a fun movie if youre a giallo fan red queen kills 7 times is a real winner to begin with its hard to go wrong with barbara bouchet and marina malfatti in the same giallo both are wonderful  especially the wideeyed innocent bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life the kill scenes in red queen kills 7 times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy one of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start the killer the red queen is one of the most overthetop and interesting looking murderers ive seen in an italian movie the 70s sets and fashions are wonderful in fact all the visuals are interesting with the laughing red queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film the convoluted plot held my interest throughout finally bruno nicolais score may be the best ive heard from the composer the main theme is so memorable i havent been able to get it out of my head for two daysbr br the only two issues i have with red queen kills 7 times come in the films finale first the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot if youve seen more than a couple gialli you wont have any problem determining who is behind the killings second the ending feels a little too rushed and as a result is a bit confusing im definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me but ill admit to being at a loss to explain it all a second viewing might just clear this up
i wanted to see valentine ever since i saw that denise richards and marley shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever when i watched valentine i was amazed at how great the story line actually was it kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all the actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor and i admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring but overall it was nonstop entertaining and suspenseful it had a mindtwisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesnt deserve all the crap it gets i recommend this movie to watch anytime but especially on valentines day because its sure to give you a ton of chills oh and dont even pay attention to the trailer or rating please dont
its a colorful slasher movie thats about itbr br it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies but i never care for such things figuring out whos the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anywaybr br the death scenes were inventive and gorey bringing back memories of 80s horror movies like friday the 13th br br another nice thing about this movie is that its hard to pinpoint the surviving girl unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious br br people who dont like slasher movies wont like this movie as simple as that i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same br br mb
i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that ive seen in years unlike the recent trend of 90s horror flicks this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being selfmocking for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here br br this is the perfect blend of 80s and 90s horror you get the style cinematography and good acting of 90s films and the stalkingslasher madness of an 80s flick i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for this is definitely a move in the right directionbr br denise richards stands out here as a fun character you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out i loved her in this movie
im not a follower of a certain movie genre i classify movies only as industrial or nonindustrial valentine is the second industrial movie of the director jamie blanks after his urban legends unlike urban legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak yet again unlike urban legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic and that is what makes valentine the best br br as the first basic and iconic element the growing hatred of the serial killer is so downtoearth since his secondary school years he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends who have made fun of him when you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie you will come to see this point of view of humanism noone is entirely good or evil in fact somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted just because the story line and the direction is very weak we are not as satisfied as we deserved br br the second iconic element is of course the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s super starlets my favourite is jessica cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed an arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in while she was playing hideandseek with her blind date never able to met with katherine heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables denise richards is killed third while she just found a valentines day gift for her at a whirlpool bath jessica capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer marley shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed finally benita ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer david boreanazbr br the third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene the valentines day celebration at dorothys house scenes and ultimately the killing themes everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as i know hard rock never suits better within a serial killermystery movie
a group of modelcaliber san francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre valentines day cards who is the killer and why is the killer after them br br my rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a filmsometimes slightly up sometimes slightly down however i cant remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for valentine the first time i watched it upon its theatrical release i thought it was pretty awfuli gave it a 4 out of 10 the equivalent of an f letter grade watching it for a second time last night i cant remember what the heck i didnt like about it i can only assume that maybe i was really in the wrong mood to watch it or maybe i just didnt get it in any event i loved it this time giving it a 9 out of 10 or an abr br it might sound ridiculous saying i didnt get a film like this but there is something to get valentine is almost a comedyhorror director jamie blanks who was also responsible for 1998s urban legend takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of scream 1996 and pushes most of the elements up a notch making valentine intentionally cheesycampy almost to the point of absurdity where absurdism is a positive stylistic term on top of that he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships the humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects most of the situations in the film and the modus operandi of the villain humorous or not are tied in to the valentines day themebr br many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various clichérooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments however in light of the above the film is intentionally clichéd implausible and ludicrous its as if blanks is attempting and mostly succeeding to transcend the typical teen slasher by mockingspoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros thats the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on valentines day its an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre making it prime fodder for valentines extravagant lampooning scream had a similar aim with its horror material but the twist there was that the film was selfaware valentines day is intentionally not selfaware the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire lest some think im reading too much into the film its worthwhile to note that blanks said in interviews that he didnt want to just do another slasher film after urban legend and producer dylan sellers said he wanted to do something more adultbr br other viewers may dislike the fact that valentines day differs so much from its putative source material the novel of the same name by tom savage the novels characters setting and plot are very different from the film sellers has said while it was a fine book i didnt think it was the right story for a film so instead the novel which is much dryer and more serious in tone was used as a launching pad a motif to create variations on for a horrorthriller story centered on valentines day while those facts wont help purists familiar with the book like the film its helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude its probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar themebr br blanks direction is impeccable visually valentines day has a lush look throughout with complex deep colors interesting sets and good staging blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark with clearly conveyed action he also directs his actors with aplomb catalyzing often slyly humorous performances david boreanaz as adam carr is involved in many of the funniest momentsbr br while valentines day is no masterpiece its a very good horrorthriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions if you watch it expecting something more tongueincheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more
i like many horror fans have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remakes and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years here at last is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxesbr br you want a hot lead actress you want vampires you want cool weapons you want cool vehicles and you want blood lots of it by the bucket load  you got itbr br with excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie beacham this really is fantastic stuffbr br despite its low budget by opting to use 35 mm stock and adding quality cg effects to the mix director james eaves has created something that feels much biggerbr br a must for old school horror fans
turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget the variety of characters is amazing from axewielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls i enjoyed the relationship between the leads not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going i also enjoyed the mix of humour which can be very easy to get wrong too muchnot enough which meant it didnt get too dark nor too spoofy it was a great step up from eaves other efforts hellbreeder and sanitarium in terms of storyline and production they have a great website which is worth checking out cant wait for bane if the level of improvement continues it should be fantastic
the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast and excellent direction by james eves the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie beecham and everyone is perfectly cast james eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action fall and then rise to a climax he does this with an element of humour plenty of twists thrills and blood this is a return of the old vampire movie with loads of gore blood and screams the movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventurebut what makes it work is that the film doesnt take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek actiongreat 
the color purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those people strongly affected by the struggles of life every character had an element of the color purple in them the movie touches on love lost hope hate and triumph whether it be celie having lived through hell and losing her sister and shug coming into her life to show her love again albert not being man righting his wrong toward celie shug shunned by her father and confesses to him in the end sofia and her stubborness good and bad and even nettie they had their emptiness and hardship through the film but was overcome in the end and thats the sign of a good movie good job to all the cast and crew
i cant believe i am just now seeing this film  i think perhaps i thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated and i avoided roots for the same reason  just as i have yet to see schindlers list  i dont want to be entertained by other peoples pain not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to bebr br so i guess the main thing i noticed about the color purple was that it was not about black people being mistreated by whites the black people were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters  or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their husbands it was painful to watch but everyone redeemed himself in the end and the acting was phenomenal i couldnt believe the character oprah played at the age of 35 and i adore whoopi to start with  she was amazing im so glad i was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and showtime was running the color purple
when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen figurine i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment but surprise surprise i loved it convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles let alone take in the ridiculous explanation these quibbles apart however the film is a dream fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno nicolai score he may not be morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so really enjoyable with lots of colour plenty of sexiness some gory kills and minimal police interference super
11 oscar nominations and zero win am yet to understand why  its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with halle berry and denzel washington  whoopi oprah margaret avery danny glover etc were all amazing  i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the oscars that year it should go into the shouldawouldacoulda category for the judges br br its an amazing book  but true to alice walkers style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters  so i am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out br br the cinematography was amazing  the african scenes live much to be desired  the african part in the book is supposed to be set in liberia  somewhere in west africa  but oh no steven spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of africa outside of the safaris  so yes there had to be a complimentary zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none west africa  and most of all why get the people to speak swahili  who in west africa speaks swahili i just had to get that out of the waybr br but as a story  amazing filmmaking  out of this world  classic yesbr br i own it and i watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation
like i said at the top four stars just arent enough its one of the best films ive ever seen in my almost 17 years of life for the people that dont really like it or understand it you must not have a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention spanbr br even if i havent seen all his films yet id have to say that this is spielberg at his peak its pretty sad to see that movies as great as the color purple dont come along too often cause i think all of us are in desperate need of firstclass motion picture entertainment in these hard timesbr br movies like this are more than just movies theyre pieces of art that need to be appreciated morebr br the idea that it was nominated for 11 oscars even best picture of the year and didnt get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid hollywood can be sometimes spielberg wasnt even nominated for best director it should have swept the oscars that yearbr br the film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some peoplebr br if only movies were still this good
in the year 1985 my birth year steven spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young africanamerican girl celie debut role for whoopi goldberg whose life is followed through rough times the story begins from the year 1909 when celie is only 14 years old she has given birth two children for her father celie has a younger sister nettie with whom she is inseparable a widower lays his eyes on nettie but their father gives celie to him it is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling women are inferior of men and especially being an africanamerican woman their rights are less than a zero celies story is a true survival storybr br the color purple is a masterpiece and underestimated film of spielberg he should make more drama which the color purple and schindlers list are good notionbr br the cast is amazing whoopi goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama danny glover was surprisingly nasty mister i have never seen him in a such an evil role the talkshow icon oprah winfrey is brilliant as a strongwilled sofiabr br warning prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film you can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like i have with my sisterbr br big applauds to mr spielberg
this movie is about development people growing and people fading people surprising and people disappointing it has it all and more there is hope frustration injustice justice love and hate it is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially whoopi goldberg in her debut rolebr br this movie made me feel very human and proud of it and i suggest that this movie should be mandatory each saturday in all prisons in the world  it touches your compassion rating 10 of 10br br ps i admit it i shed a tear of joy during the final scene
steven speilbergs adaptation of alice walkers popular novel is not without its share of controversy when first released members of the black community criticised its treatment of black men while others questioned why a white man was directing this film about black womenbr br this is the story of a young black woman named celie growing up in rural america after the turn of the century she has two children by her abusive father which are snatched from her arms at birth her only solace in her miserable life comes from her sisterbr br celie played in later years by newcomer whoopie goldberg is married off to an abusive husband danny glover the husband is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from celies lifebr br the story is often heartbreaking as celie keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters including sophia a tough as nails wife to her step son and shug a loud and luscious saloon singer who teaches her a thing or two about lovebr br speilbergs direction is all over this picture which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances i dare you to watch this film and not be moved the film the color purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story while it tends to minimise the lesbian aspects as well as the african story both of which were so vivid in the book the movie remains true to its themes allowing the voice of alice walker to shine throughbr br i couldnt begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film suffice it to say however this is one of the few films that i can watch again and again and which has left an indelible mark on mebr br 
this is an excellent film with an extraordinary cast and acting i was very disappointed with the academy awards when this didnt get the oscar for best film and for best actress woopi goldberg it certainly deserved it in any case take a look at it i am sure you will enjoy it very much
this movie is so wonderful its hard to find words to describe it this is the only time i cant decide which was better the book or the moviebr br whoopi goldberg is awesome and oprah winfrey such a good actress she could be funny happy and miserable all at the same time all together the movie was well directed by steven speilberg and should not be passed up 910
the color purple is truly amazing there is none like it and i dont think there ever will be its a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer takes on the actors are flawless and the directing is superb i absolutely loved it a movie has never made me so happy it is beautiful thats the best way to explain it
the color purple is a masterpiece it displays the amazing acting abilities of whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey and danny glover not only is steven spielberg the most incredible director of all time but his versatility shines through in this film if you ever want to see what a movie can do watch this its a beautiful portrayal of one of the most moving stories of all time
absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time i have seen it at least a hundred times and i cant go through it without crying i defy anyone to watch the reunion of celie and nettie or shug and father and not feel your eyes getting misty whoopie goldberg should have one an award for amazing portrayal and for the person who said you cant love the movie if you loved the book wrong im a testament to that
another good stooge shortchristine mcintyre is so lovely and evil and the same time in this oneshe is such a great actressthe stooges are very good and especially shemp and larrythis to is a good one to watch around autumn time
ive seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time i still felt itbr br the story itself was incredible but came alive by spielbergs expertise and the fabulous cast including whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey danny glover and margaret avery akosua busia deserved an oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of nettiebr br youll experience every human emotion while watching this film i laughed cried and got angry like most great movies it was looked over by the academy with a host of nominations but no wins but this movie without a doubt is definitely one of the best films of all time
i remember when this film was up for the academy awards and did not win in any category for the life of me i cannot remember what it was up against but one thing i can say it was one of the best movies i have ever seen and the fact that steven spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bitbr br essentially it is about a black womans trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman there are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with along the way we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption whoopi goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie danny glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film br br and the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent beloved did i encourage anyone of any race to see this film 910
steven spielberg wanted to win an oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldnt win by directing special effects epics he was nominated for three of them close encounters of the third kind raiders of the lost ark and et the extraterrestrial so he decided to get very serious by directing the color purple a period film with no special effects spielbergs first serious drama is a remarkable movie but the academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didnt give spielberg any respect the color purple received 11 oscar nominations including best picture but spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he wasnt nominated for best director it got worse on oscar night when this film didnt win a single oscar it got completely shut out that wasnt right the color purple should have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi goldbergs spectacular film debut as celie a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband frightfully placed by danny glover then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as sofia one of those friends of celie since im from chicago i had already known winfrey from her talk show which at the time of this films release hadnt gone nationwide like goldberg what a film debut margaret avery is terrific as shug avery another friend who also happens to be the mistress of celies rotten husband all three actresses received welldeserved oscar nominations for their work here goldberg for best actress winfrey and avery for best supporting actress set in the south during the first half of the 20th century the color purple is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end it also made me laugh at times too why academy voters were so hard on not nominating spielberg for best director is a mystery that still puzzles me today but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for schindlers list and saving private ryan making him one of the best movie directors of alltime but he should have gotten nominated for this movie the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like et to a serious drama like the color purple was remarkablebr br  out of four
this movie is such a moving amazing piece of work i saw it at the theater when it came out but i was only 13  didnt really quite get it i saw it again when i was 20 on video of course  i now own it  was just blown away steven spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end i have read the book as well but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life the casting acting music costuming scenery everything it just wonderful you laugh you cry you cheer it brings out every emotion imaginable it is one of his finest pieces of work  should not be missed
rating 1010 master piecebr br some years ago i heard spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance well mr spielberg i guess nothing is perfect but this movie  together with schindlers list  is your best even oprah acts well in this one br br what got me most is the realism of the story and drama stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world
this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen i was about 12 years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on tv i my eyes are glued to it the acting and plot are amazing it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama
spielbergs first dramatic film is no letdown its a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an africanamerican woman it also proves that not all movies that have the africanamerican ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an africanamerican directorbr br what i love about this movie is spielbergs ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book furthermore danny glover was excellent as mr and usually hes just himself throughout most of his movies but in this he completely branches out and is someone else for once but the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from whoopi goldberg she is excellent as celie you will never forget these characters once youve seen this moviebr br now i heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well and all i can say is i hope its about as good as this one is because this one is a film that shouldnt be missed
genteel softly spoken drama from steven spielberg was his first real venture into this genre a departure from his normal adventurefantasy fare it paved the way for his 1993 success schindlers listbr br based upon alice walders pulitzer prize winning novel the story concerns a young girls arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister nettie while the plot  about compassion abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds  is often powerful and moving it loses its way through the fault of continuity and menno meyjes scrambling screenplay the color purple is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame this lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in miss walkers novel a real shame that maestro spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a directorbr br performances are strong throughout with whoopi goldberg making a debut  which shes never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment  as the heart broken celie who just yearns to be loved danny glover lends solid support though his moses was a superior turn for him in places in the heart the standout showing comes from the unheralded oprah winfrey as miss sophia the single minded fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising upper class white woman good support also from margaret avery adolph caesar and rae dawn chongbr br quincy jones  coproducer with spielberg kathleen kennedy and frank marshall  has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion editing from michael kahn is sound as always while director of photography allen daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious southern scenerybr br this true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questionsbr br wednesday january 15 1997  video
these days spielbergs the color purple is mostly remembered for being nominated for eleven oscars and winning zilch whats even more alarming is that spielberg himself wasnt even nominated for best director needless to say the filmmakers deserved more acclaim than they were accordedbr br the story concerns the trials and tribulations of celie johnson whoopi goldberg an africanamerican woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband the film spans several years and focuses mainly on celies relationships with the women around her its told from a decidedly female perspective but you neednt fear that its a saccharine chick flickbr br the story is an interesting one livened with humour at times although the central characters struggles are paramount some may not appreciate the change in tone towards the films end but i didnt mind even though similar content in a lesser film would likely have me rolling my eyesbr br the film received three oscar nominations for acting whoopi goldberg best actress oprah winfrey best supporting actress and margaret avery best supporting actress i think that goldberg and winfrey were certainly deserving and danny glover was unaccountably stiffedbr br as already mentioned spielberg didnt receive a best director nomination for his efforts such an omission beggars belief since spielbergs direction here is topnotch im not especially crazy about quincy joness score but its not below average by any meansbr br in the end the story is a satisfying one welltold by a master filmmaker working from pulitzer prizewinning material give it a try and youll probably be as baffled as i am about how it could be so poorly treated on oscar night
1985 was a good year for films  maybe even great  but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party membersbr br 11 nominations and not a single title such was the academys disdain for one of their greatest directors and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for schindlers list which is arguably not as good and im halfpolishbr br dont get me wrong schindler was a classic and im not knocking out of africa which won that year either but it was in my mind a class behind this one an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears  and im not a big cryerbr br maybe it was the music superb or the cinematography sumptuous but more likely simply the acting whoopi who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne danny glover who id never heard of before and of course oprahbr br the rest is history but at the time who knew
of the elements that make this the best at this point i have to say 1 is christine mcintire shemps scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent i imagine that as one poster suggested christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil to be smiling at shemps possibly dyingbr br another character who helps this stand out is the goon his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goofball hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or for that matter anywhere i would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this but hey when a short is this good whos going to complain not i
taking a break from his escapist run in the early 80s steven spielberg directed whoopi goldberg in an adaptation of alice walkers the color purple about about the desperate existence of an africanamerican woman in the 1930s watching goldberg play celie its incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like sister act this is the sort of movie that could easily be  no make that should be  part of the curriculum in black studies and womens studies theres one scene that may be the most magnificent editing job thats ever been on screen youll know it when you see it i cant believe that this didnt win a single oscar it may be spielbergs second best movie behind schindlers list maybe even tied with it also starring danny glover adolph caesar margaret avery oprah winfrey willard e pugh akosua busia and laurence fishburne
i gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie but for its pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience the story of onewomansstruggleagainstallodds is an old cliché by now but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as the color purplebr br it also showed a different side to the africanamerican experience  showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated white man and were abusive of their own people i find this an important point as it goes against the portraywhiteonblackviolenceandwinanoscar trendbr br also the acting performances are superb  especially oprah who i now have a new found respect forbr br well worth watching  but keep some tissue handy
one of the finest films ever made why it only got a 76 rating is a mystery this film is a window into the world of the black experience in america should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10 i recommend watching it with the long walk home as a companion piece if you think whoopi goldbergs work is about homer and eddie or hollywood squares think again dont miss this movie which should have won the oscar and read the book too
this film captured my heart from the very beginning when hearing quincy jones first notes or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flowers in the meadows this is truly a film to cry and die for the whole cast gives the best performance in a film ive seen in years and spielberg has really outdone himself whoppi goldberg margaret avery oprah winfreyoh lord danny glover and the others all give us their best and you can feel it  almost touch it goldberg is celie she gives her that insecurity and feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character and we grow with her we grow strong together with her throughout the movie and we triumph with her margaret avery is wonderful as shug avery even when shes at her most arrogant and shows us that sinners indeed have souls too the always sympathetic charming danny glover makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music ofid say sirquincy jones adds even more beauty to this splendid film the photography the music the director and the music makes this beautiful soulful movie into an experience of life you dont want to miss it sistaremember my name
the film version of alice walkers hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel written largely as letters from the central character celie to god was a massive oscar success and rightly sobr br in the role of the abused and awakened celie whoopi goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles not far behind her was oprah winfrey as sofia the fiery woman tamed by fate others in the cast fleshed out the characters walker had introduced so clearly on the page  danny glover as albert celies abusive husband margaret avery as shug a force of change for the good willard pugh and rae dawn chong as harpo and squeak susan beaubian as corrine the preachers wife and the muchmissed carl anderson otherwise best known as judas in the 1973 film of jesus christ superstar as preacher samuelbr br beautifully paced and sensitively written the color purple does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a featurelength drama
a film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker the fact is steven spielberg probably our greatest storyteller has been doing this in various movie formats for years the color purple at the time was considered risky especially after action classics like jaws and raiders of the lost ark in hindsight this film should have come as no surprise for spielberg had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in et critics called color purple his entrance into intellectual fare it is quite an entrance no special effects no swashbuckling just brilliant storytelling based on a literary classic by alice walker one surprise is how spielberg could present such a moving film about africanamericans in the deep south slavery is gone but in the south depicted here it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves br br spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience this is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations it is the first in a line of films people either didnt see or wouldnt see because there are no aliens empire of the sun always schindlers list etc his awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because a he uses mostly untrained firsttime actors b he tackles a subject most felt was unadaptable to the screen and c it is pure drama with no strings pulled where characters grow and change over the passage of roughly 30 years it is almost epiclike in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single academy award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insultbr br whoopi goldberg is fabulous as the tortured celie an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive danny glover who she only knows as mister the film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with mister the pg13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the walker novel this is not the burning bed in georgia by any means there is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected it happens gracefully goldberg perfectly plays a human being someone in need of love and someone who deserves it the films most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when goldberg and her sister nettie played by akosua busia are separated maybe forever possibly foreshadowing holocaust separation of child and parent you may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequencebr br the color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people there really is something to live for but love triumphs over all spielberg bashers take note the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliensbr br rating 10 of 10
tsui harks visual artistry is at its peek in this movie unfortunately the terrible acting by ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung i felt the urge to strangle her while watching this its that bad  made it difficult to watch at timesbr br this movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department when i first saw this my jaw dropped repeatedly and i thought to myself that ive never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of chinese historical kungfu novels without a doubt this is one of the bestlooking chinese historical kungfu epic ever madebr br but alas tsui hark hasnt improved much in the writing department and the story and dialog are rather juvenile his apparent obsession with the silly and overlylong depiction of the evil guys didnt help either to make it worse this movie is very badly cast they decided to use the hot popular hong kong idols as lead characters but unfortunately both ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung are totally unsuited for historical kungfu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody adam cheng siuchow and brigitte lin in the 1983 version are infinitely betterbr br i wish that someday zhang yimou and tsui hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of tsui but with the maturity and storytelling poetry of zhang
this movie is good its not the best of the great cg kung fu flicks but its pretty good first thing first the story is actually good the whole idea of gods vs fallen gods type deal with super powers is pretty cool my problem is theres too many characters it got very confusing when they switched scenes the special effects were incredible the fighting scenes were very fast paced and complex this movie practically all computer generated the acting is superb as always expected from such high profile players ekin cheng makes an excellent protagonist loner character zhang ziyi did nothing for me in this movie i thought she would have a bigger part but she did one fight scene and a whole lot of yapping the bad guy the whole skull army and the whole blood cloud thing is very frightening the music is also excellent to me this story deserve at least a miniseries and not just one movie theres too much story to cram in 2 hours maybe if there was a book or something i would be able to keep up with all the characters and the details this movie sacrifices story integrity for action i reccomend storm riders over this any day
and i love it lots of special effects and for a movie thats not made on mega budget this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece im one of the guys who didnt understand the story at all but this was still a great flick to watch its definitely up there in standards surpassing bored of the rings and on par with movies like harry potter which is saying a lot for a movie again made on a fraction of the budget of these international hitsbr br one thing i really love about this movie is that it so stretches the envelope of adventure movie to come out of hong kong the topic is exotic and original production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of hk for fantasy action movie and acting is greatbr br one of the best movies to come out of hong kong this is the infernal affairs of hong kong fantasy movie and i hope theyll continue working in this area until they surpass hollywood adventure moviesbr br just fantastic
yeah right sammo hung already acted in the main role in 1983s zu warrios from the magic mountain now 2001 he does it again with zu warriors but this time he finally does it right you seldom see him in wuxia more often in classic eastern or crime slapstick but this role simply does fit him the ancient chinese legend about zu mountain is not often represented in movies as far as i know about movies translated for the west although the legend contains a vast of interesting stories and possibilities straight said you havent seen a story alike yet in a modern movie and that makes it so great and wow all the colors plus the enormously deep rightintotheheart going story makes you fall for this movie in an instant the first time i watched it i had to watch it again instantly and i did ok true i didnt understand all of it the first time but that makes it only better you know you didnt understand all of it because there is so much spice in it therefor it is a pleasure for one self to watch it over and over again and yeah it grows deeper in your heart the more often you watch itbr br summary a story to love characters you cry with and truly a movie you never forget  editors note well i think i must watch it right now again d
one of the very best three stooges shorts ever a spooky house full of evil guys and the goon challenge the alert detective agencys best men shemp is in top form in the famous inthedark scene emil sitka provides excellent support in his mr goodrich role as the target of a murder plot before its over shemps trusty little shovel is employed to great effect this 16 minute gem moves about as fast as any stooges short and packs twice the wallop highly recommended
the first thing i thought when i saw this films was it is not really a film at least it is not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word film it is entirely symbolic everything in it has a figurative meaning so if you are not used to express thing in a symbolic way you will find it strange if you are not acquainted with philosophy religion spiritual life you will think its just a fairytale and even a weird one chaotic for me the legend of zu is perfectly transparent and i do like it it tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness the fight that is as old as humanity and every one who is in search of the sens in this life is confronted with it the film is obviously made by buddhists i am not a buddhist my religion and the vision of the world and human is different but as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other it is a really beautiful film and i which we had more films like this  films that have a meaning there are too many empty stories which are good only to make time pass more quickly
zuthe warriors from magic mountain was and is an impressive classic you never would have guessed it was made in 1983 tsui harks use of special effects was very creative and inventive he continued doing this in the chinese ghost story trilogy and later productions even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre legend of zu is connected to zuwarriors from magic mountain it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one the plot is a bit hard to follow but to be honest it doesnt matter it is all about the action and adventure i always was wondering what tsui hark would do if he got his hands on cgi now we knowhe made this movie maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that there is so much happening on the screenyou simply wont believe i think it is a big shame that this movie wasnt shown in theaters here in holland because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like superman returns or xmen 3 the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor in most of tsui harkss movies he combines dramafantasymartial arts and humor somehow it is missing in this movie again i am not going to be picky about these small matters legend of zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see a true classic
the legend of zu as i saw it was a very interesting story i think many of the people who didnt like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the film they were expecting something akin to star wars and it was not that joseph campbell i believe would have liked this film there were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked we all have a mountain of swords within us we all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives we all have to face our own insomnia someday granted some of the narration was a bit confusing and some of the action got a little hokey at times but i think other points of the film easily made up for it id watch it again br br i dont know if theres a difference between the legend of zu which i saw in mandarin with english subtitles and zu warriors the dubbed usa version it might have been dumbed down for american audiences which really would have detracted from this film
for those of you who love lord of the rings and love special effects watch this movie this will be sure to keep you glued to the screen you will probably even like it if you like watching people fight with magical stuff
this is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind tsui hark it is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to steven chows shaolin soccer from the moment the movie startedthere was astronishing backdrops at every edge which werebr br deplicted with superb style if you are a science fiction or chinese martial arts geek youll love the excessive amounts of many 3d effects and realistic computer generated weapons there comes a fine performanceas always from ekin cheung who plays sky king he teams up with louis koored who i was very impressed by his flexible wing which deflected incoming attacks the fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way not only is the action superb but the has a somewhat complex storyline many criticisers of this movie complain of the lack of storytheme or just shoved in random bits of debrise and even describe as the legend of poo however the viewer cannot rely on watching dragon ballz and other similar manga cartoons to understand this movie others who are famarialy with wu xia movies will have a better appoach in due respect there can be one weakness that could be foreseen the blow that was deliveried to the enemy at the very last fight scene could of been more substantially and devastiingly madein spite of all this its a must see
visually stunning and full of eastern philosophy this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director tsui hark the man behind some of the best films hong kong cinema has produced the special effects are beautiful and imaginative the plot is a bit on the cerebral side but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons if thinking is not your forte however this may not be your movie maybe you should go see the latest from the hollywood studios no brain club but if you are looking for something more hes where you will find it
legend of zubr br i remember well tsui harks original zu warriors made 18 years earlier over one christmas on a rare week when channel 4 in the uk showed a week of hong kong movies zu warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that its been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprogbr br in fact i think the original zu warriors is one of the earliest films i saw as a kid that i can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from and the memories of seeing yuen biao sammo hung and others in their classic primebr br so when i saw this remake of zu warriors there was a feeling of apprehension could it beat the dreamy childhood memories i had of the original or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken necks you find in those kung fu moviesbr br well the answer is i cant say but that was because this isnt really a remake the stories and styles are almost completely differentbr br the legend of zu tells of the story of king sky a lone warrior whose master dawn declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called insomnia two hundred years later insomnia returns dawn is reincarnated as enigma and insomnia has returned to destroy zu meanwhile white eyebrows and red try with the help of king sky to stop insomniabr br the plot isnt one full of twists and turns but had enough detail in it to keep me interested but i can see this film as one you either love or you hate the film is very much about the special effects with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments much like the storm riders and a man called hero but unlike the other two this film was one which didnt overdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful nothing appears rushed  unlike hero the backgrounds were complementary to the acting and not at all overpowering the scenesbr br the story also involves plenty of characters and the intermingling of so many individuals does make the film intriguing it was possibly on the verge of too many cooks but generally each character had its part in the story but some of the roles appear to be extended cameos in my opinion and i somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of thisbr br ekin cheng and louis koo play very central roles in the film but i couldnt say this film showed their best performances cecilia cheung appears to at least have matured in her acting but it is still quite raw kelly lin was the new revelation for me despite her very short role i have apologise and admit to oglingbr br overall i have to say did enjoy this film as much as i enjoyed the original given that both movies are made by the legendary tsui hark the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in hong kong has changed over two decades and one beauty of that is the fact that you cant really compare the two films at all as much as apples are apples and pears are pearsbr br ultimately both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right and im going back to reminisce by watching the original againbr br two to watch but not compare
i have to admit that tsui hark is one of a kind you cant top a person with a strong style of movie presence a chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of zu mountain and this is what he displayedbr br the new legend of zu has truly improved from the one in 1983 from this new millenium update we could see tsui harks vision of the zu mountains spectacular visual designs amazing actionfantasy epic made beautifully well kept me glued through the entire picture great cast with just fine acting its truly a fun movie to watch but is it too weirdbr br now the down side is people will definitely get confused with its broad story line shortened down into a 95 minute movie plot may not have much relation among characters but by rewatching the movie youll have a better sense of understanding the characters itself some can complain there isnt too much physical combat besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat foes spirits fighting by handtohand wouldnt really make sense at all br br i appreciated this nice stylish picture it may have a thin story but hey look at tsui harks time  tide we got confused by the plot as well but it was truly something stylish and awesome tsui hark always attracts something different into hk cinema american audiences may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie cause this aint no crouching tiger hidden dragon this is a whole new genre although it may not be a masterpiece but its special effects is truly better than storm riders this is really worth checking out
im stunt i must admit i never saw a movie with such good story and none stop high special effect martial art fighting scene if you like the fantastic genre like me you will certainly be more than satisfied all character have very cool power and the special effect are near perfection in one word flawless i will listen to this movie a lot in the next years
this movie is very cool if youre a fan of tsui hark and chinese fantasy films you should love this this film is the asian lord of the rings a high fantasy story based in actual chinese mythology i realize many critics have called this film plotless i think they probably have zero knowledge of chinese mythology if you liked stormriders or warriors of heaven  earth this one should be right up your alley this film is still very difficult to find in the us even though it was purchased for us distribution along with crouching tiger hidden dragon and iron monkey well worth the search this dvd is also worthy of owning
this is apparently one of shemps first shorts with the stooges this excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team but the threesomes comedic timing is at its honed best here aside from the intense slapstick scenes there are others more subtle but just as funny watch larry when shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot or watch the real object prompting moes exclamation ohhighly polished mahoganybr br emil sitka is at his bewildered goofiest and the goon may look scary but hes somehow funny he seems as frustrated and perplexed with the stooges as are regular people in other shortsbr br for shemp aficionados this is a must have episode it wont disappoint
all the worlds a stage and its people actors in itor something like that who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pitor even at the theatre door why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience including the story itselfbr br this film was a grand experiment that said hey the story is you and it needs more than your attention it needs your active participation sometimes we bring the story to you sometimes you have to go to the storybr br alas no one listened but that does not mean it should not have been said
when tsui hark experiments nothing and no one can withstand him legend of zu is possibly 6hours condensed into 1h40 one does not understand all but like at 2001 a space odyssey you also dont have to but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture an extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering astounding rejoicing in the recent years vital severe masterpiece its absolutely perfect as it isbr br when tsui hark experiments nothing and no one can withstand him legend of zu is possibly 6hours condensed into 1h40 one does not understand all but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture an extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering astounding rejoicing in the recent years vital severe masterpiece its absolutely perfect as it is 1000000000000010000000000000
i just came back from hong kong on my summer vacation and saw the legend of zu i thought it kicked as it was so creative and unique its the crouching tiger hidden dragon with a lot less drama even if some thought there was too much special fxyeah right you cant complain about the cast zhang ziyi and cecilia cheung are so fine the legend of zukicks as
i have previously seen zu warriors from the magic mountain in that film the setting takes place in chinas mountains the legend of zu looks like another dimension thank that to tsui harks extensive use of cgi effects hes able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds a land where beings fly freely and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades split swords and the ultra cool moon orbbr br while there are many characters in this one the focus is mainly on king sky and enigma the romance aspect is there although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor cecilia cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching in the beginning i like how she resembles the countess from zu warriors and she does well playing enigma as she deals with facing her past life oh by the way did i mention that cecilias very appealing to the eyebr br in truth zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 tsui hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema
i remember that the trailer for legend of zu was quite impressive and being a fan of a man called hero my all time favourite storm riders i decided that i must watch this one too i know that there is way to much critcism on ekin chengs acting ability everywhere but he is my favourite hong kong moviestar so far way better than nicolas tse neverthelessand he is one of the factors that i enjoyed this movie without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end i even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this film they must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that the storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in i guess ekin cheng pulls the girls easilythe story is not very intellectual and deep but that is not what you expect when watcing an action movie i wished there were more martial arts action with fists and fist instead of battles with magical abilities but well thats life and it never goes the way you want it to and why did they sound like supersonic planes in the battle through the sky in the end  thats way too funny legend of zu cannot be a man called hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that is not a bad thing at all if a company decides to publish games on this movie i will not get suprised as it carries all the videogames elements good work please make more fantasy movies like this
this is like crouching tiger hidden dragon in a more surreal fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame the plot may be hard to follow but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience however an intelligent person should be able to keep up moreover the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi
ive been a fan of xu ke hark tsui for many year since school this film is the best fantasy movie in years i dont think action is the right genre though therere lot of action and kongfu scenese wait did i mentioned this is an oriental fantasy moive please keep in mind that do not use hollywood formula to rate this film and for the guy who poo around i dont blame you cause you still young and need to know more about culture
this is one amazing movie you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical there are always stories behind stories i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore i studied them in schoolit is very complicated you just have to take what it gives youenjoy the movie and enjoy the ridehooray
o my gosh just give me a minute to breath this movie takes you on an awesome ride and doesnt let you go until the very last blow in your face ending this is the the movie for fans of stormriders and such legend of zu was beautifully created although i didnt like a few things they used alot of stand ins i wanted to see the real person fight but oh well a few small let downsand i didnt really like it a lot until i watched it again when you understand it more it totally kicks a i encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true asian movie to see this movie i give this movie one of my highest ratingsgo and see it when it comes out in america
i cant tell you all how much i love this movie i have read reviews that say that this move is too confusing or like swimming in drying concrete i say that these reviewers have no imagination for anyone who loves fantasy fiction this movie is for you if you ever loved playing dungeons  dragons this movie is for you especially if you got into the oriental adventures im just sorry that i did not get to see this movie on the big screen just more incentive to get my own big screen tv 
legend of zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years it transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art with unmatched visual sceneries and story of divine proportions legend of zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its majesty this movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life the acting is perfect for this type of movie if you were an immortal with supernatural powers i would think youd keep more to yourselfbr br unlike the comments of many the plot is actually quite easy to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not be paying attention since or are used to such levels of sophistication as the titanic the plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air legend of zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur allow yourself to be completely engulfed within its fantastical vision and you will grow to love this movie
an ultranervous old man mr goodrich terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it saying you will be next br br he calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier of course its the stooges who couldnt respond because had come into the office robbed them and tied them up some detectives the moment poor mr goodrich hangs up the phone and says i feel safer already a monstertype goon named nico appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious we next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that now these crooks have to deal with the detectives that are coming by the house for mr goodrichbr br some of the gags like moe and larrys wrinkles are getting a bit old but some of them will provoke laughs if i see them 100 times i always laugh at shemp trying to be a flirt as he does here with mr goodrichs niece in a classic routine with a long accordionlike camera lens the act he puts on when hes poisoned is always funny too shemp was so good that i didnt mind he was taking the great curlys placebr br larry moe curlyshemp were always great in the chase scenes in which monsters or crooks or both are chasing them around a house thats the last six minutes in here at times such as this film
i rented this film in dvd form without knowing anything at all about it part of a winter marathon of watching a film every night after several awful american action adventure films ballistic daredevil cradle of life zhu warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking the story is complete nonsense but i found the films sincerity good heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing and the film looks spectacular sure the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by hollywood but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking in one shot two of the superhuman characters stand on craggy spires of rock a huge moon rising before them the image perfectly balanced by the three elements in another a princesswarrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heatseeking missile and the colors explode from shot to shot used to express emotion rather than to represent realitybr br the characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply physically several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful they play their roles straight up without irony or guile and so are believablebr br most strange of all despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations i found myself very near tears at the end moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original goodhearted vision of the directorbr br 
this movie is well done on so many levels that i am in awe that the score is as low as it is 5910576 votes as of this writing this movie has incredible special effects a true epic storyline complex great character interaction and mindblowing battles  they have to be seen to be believed the only complaint i have is the subtitles on the hk dvd version i got some lines were not translated  br br i just dont understand when i read  hear from various sources it has a confusing plot i couldnt follow the story or characters came from nowhere from the very 1st time i watched this movie i understood it followed it knew why characters were there and i absolutely loved it ive watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment oh and this is not just my opinion because ive shown this movie to many fellow americans people who have never seen an hk film before who feel the same way not one of them failed to follow the storyline and each person declared their love for this movie oh man why cant we have stuff like this coming out of hollywood at least lord of the rings had a nice marriage of special effects character development and storylinebr br this is not coming from a asian film lover newbie either i own an extensive library of asian films and i must say that this movie is one of my greatest dvds when you watch it you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie you will be drawn into this fantasy world and you wont want to leave ive seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 both done by tsui hark and the 2001 is far better in comparison imobr br besides the subtitles i have one additional complaint about this movie i didnt want it to end im begging you mr hark  can we please have a sequel
i liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole susan sarandon is such a good actor that she made an interesting strong character out of mediocre writing the true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome
sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment most demille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip the story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments the action takes us from an indian raid on a cabin one of the best parts of the movie with jean arthur excellent while attempting to appease the warpainted natives this is followed by her and cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured later comes a protracted battle with the cheyenne the whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish jean arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here
cecil b demille really knew how to create a classic and after 7 decades his western comes across as the real mccoy engrossing entertaining spectacular in no way outdatedbr br as a real fan of tvs deadwood ill tell you the performances of gary cooper as wild bill hickock and jean arthor as calamity jane are far more ontargetbr br we dont have any giants in hollywood anymore plainsman is just one of dozens of classics from the 19361945 decade that have seen enduring commercial life decade after decade released reissued reissued all over again filmmakers like todays spielberg jackson bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandbox none of todays movies will be sought out in 7 months let alone 70 years
the master of movie spectacle cecil b de mille goes west using three legends of the old west as its protagonists they probably never metgary cooper is portraying wild bill hickockjames ellison as buffalo bill and jean arthur does make a nice calamity jane the story serves only for de mille to hang some marvelous action sequences on like the big indian attackscenes like that are extremely well doneif you dont mind the somewhat overthetop performances of the cast this is an very entertaining westernlook out for a very young anthony quinn essaying the role of an indian brave who participated at the battle of little big hornthis part got him at least noticed in hollywood
the plainsman is an entertaining western no doubt a classic which is actual even today gary cooper is wild bill hickok ideal for the role together with john wayne and james stewart they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation jean arthur is great as calamity jane nobody that i know played it better than her even if might not be historically accurate the film manages to capture the most important about hickok and about the time it takes place sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that is what demille does here the friendship of hickok with buffalo bill the selling of rifles to the indians by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have because of the end of the civil war custer and little big horn the uneasy relationship between buffalo bills wife a religious woman with hickok a man who had killed plenty also the unusual love affair between hickok and calamity all this makes the plainsman a non conventional and interesting film anthony quinn has a very short appearance that already shows what a great actor he was going to become a lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time
this movie has wild bill hickok calamity jane buffalo bill and general custer all together gary cooper plays wild bill and jean arthur plays calamity jane and charles bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the indians and you can hardly recognize him this was the first time cecil b demille and gary cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time this movie starts out with lincolns assassination and it also deals with an indian war calamity jane is in love with wild bill and buffalo bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home this movie also deals with custers last stand and is far from accurate gary cooper is good as usual and i usually dont like jean arthur but i liked her here
this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every levelhowever if your after the true facts about such legends as hickcockcody and calamity jane then look elsewhere as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legendthe story moves with a cracking pace and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this moviethe sharp eyed amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an indian scout also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior he actually married one of demilles daughters in real lifeindeed its quinns character who informs cooper of the massacre of custer told in flash back the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the american west with american historyso please take time out to watch this classic western
this cecil b demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean arthurs finest performance as a hysterical eccentric incurably amoral but devotedly doting calamity jane she really pulled it off gary cooper is at his most taciturn but manages some occasional pithy sayings the plains are big but trails cross  sometimes the story is a pastiche to end all pastiches all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james even abraham lincoln opens the story in person or at least demille would have us believe so there is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety this is a stomp em in the face tale for the masses a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what eisenhower was eventually to name the military industrial complex it isnt just a story about gunrunners but about arming anyone for money and doing so from the heart of washington but lets not get into politics lets leave that to demille who can be guaranteed to be superficial the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george antheil who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography bad boy of music antheil seems to have originated the big sound adopted by all subsequent westerns whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies that is why it does not sound at all unusual because we have heard it a thousand times but he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into american mythic lore and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then corny as it may be but doubtless appropriate it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a cheyenne indian gabby hayes is in there somewhere but you miss him in the crowd gary cooper overtops them all looming large  but when did he ever loom small
who done it contains many surefire laughs and gags it is not only one of the best stooges films with shemp it is one of the finest short comedies columbia produced director bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the stooges but when curly howard suffered a careerending stroke it was tailored for the columbia comedy team of schilling and lane their version was released as pardon my terror it obviously was too good for the stooges to pass up and it was finally filmed by the stooges at the end of 1947br br old man goodrich calls ace detectives shemp larry and moe out of fear that he will be murdered when they arrive at his home goodrich has disappeared and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the stooges will they find goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice br br shemp is particularly funny in this film his reactions after being given a mickey by christine mcintyre are superb he gives his trademark sound eeebeeebeeeb and miss mcintyre is noticeably trying not to laugh other funny scenes the closeup of moes mug looking through the camera lens and the inthedark fight with all cast members involvedbr br nikko the goon played by duke york is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a stooges film with his kinked hair he could almost pass for a stooge if he didnt tower over everyone else who done it is a gem among the stooges films with shemp even diehard curly fans will enjoy this one a true stooge classic 9 out of 10
this film provides the saga of a legendary wild bill hickock he buffalo bill cody and calamity jane are the central charactersbr br as the civil war closes lincoln mentions his concern that the countrys dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice go west young man which mercifully the film didnt erroneously attribute to horace greeley as a number of others did but then he gets assassinated and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the american indiansbr br in the meantime we see wild bill hickock who interacts with a small boy while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the mississippi wild bill uses a bowie knife which he eventually gives to the boy calling it an arkansas toothpick which in reality was a different type of knife though both were used throughout the frontierbr br hickock eventually meets buffalo bill cody who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man cody has just gotten married and is bringing his bride to the old west to settle downbr br when they arrive at their destination they run into calamity jane who has a crush on hickock she looks at codys wife and asks buffalo bill is this your mopsy the line was one that caused the hayes board some problem since one definition of mopsy was prostitute demille wanted the line in and one of his aides pointed out that in beatrix potters books about peter rabbit three of the rabbits were flopsy mopsy and cottontail he pointed this out and asked the censors to identify the rabbit of ill virtue it worked the line stayed inbr br the indians were getting restless in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the eastern financiers cody and hickock were asked to help scout the area so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area cody led the troops hickock went to check out the activities of an indian chief who was an old acquaintance and who was leading some of the hostile indiansbr br calamity jane gets captured and hickock gets captured trying to save her they are brought to the chief and although neither would talk torture applied to hickock breaks calamity janes willpower and she tells the route cody is usingbr br the two are released and hickock joins up with cody and his forces in part to alert them theyre walking into a trap with hickoks help they hold off the indian attackbr br hickock decides to go after the gun runners and finally takes them prisoner as theyre waiting for authorities hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cardsbr br there are numerous historic anomalies in the film but it retains the flavor of legend pretty good for the 1930s
after the failure of the crusades at the box office cecil b demille stopped doing films about nonamerican history his films for the next thirteen years were about our history from jean lafitte to world war ii dr wassell the first in order of production was this film starring gary cooper as wild bill hickok with jean arthur as calamity jane james ellison was buffalo bill john miljan not a villain as usual was general george a custer and anthony quinn was one of the indians who fought at little big horn the villains were led by charles bickford selling arms to the indians and porter hall as jack mccall who killed wild bill hickokbr br basically the film takes up the history of the us after the civil war lincoln is shown at the start talking about what is the next step now that lee has surrendered lincoln talks about the need to secure the west more about this point later then he announces he has to go to the theater that april 14th must have been very busy for abe  in virginia city he grants a pardon to errol flynn at the request of miriam hopkins on the same datebr br actually while lincoln was concerned about the west his immediate thoughts on the last day of his presidency were about reunifying the former confederate states and its citizens into the union as soon as possible it was reconstruction that occupied his attention not the west except for the problems of maximillian and his french controlled forces in mexico against juarez but he had been involved in actual problems with the west in 1862 he sent disgraced general john pope the loser at second manassas to minnesota to put down a serious indian war by the sioux the subject of mckinley kantors novel sprit lake pope incompetent against lee and jackson turned out to be quite effective here and the revolt was smashedbr br however with all lincolns actual attention to western problems it is doubtful that he says as cooper repeats at least once the frontier should be secure there is nothing to say he could not have said it but it is hardly a profound pronouncement by a leading statesman like saying teddy roosevelt said eat a good breakfast every morning for your health it is not a profound statement of policy it is at best a statement of recognizable fact cooper turning it into a minor mantra like lincolns version of the monroe doctrine is ridiculoustypical of the way demilles scripts have really bad errors of common sense in thembr br however this is not a ruinous mistake the plainsman is an adventure film and as such it has the full benefit of demille the film creator of spectacle as such it is well worth watching but not as a textbook on lincolns political ideas or his quotable legacy
the plainsman represents the directorial prowess of cecil b demille at its most inaccurate and unfactual it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok gary cooper buffalo bill cody james ellison calamity jane jean arthur george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship the film is an attempt to buttress custers last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends truly this is the world according to demille  a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment but a pretty campy relic by todays standardsbr br transfer considering the vintage of the film this is a moderately appealing transfer with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks theres a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments all in all the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract the audio is mono but nicely balancedbr br extras forget it its universal bottom line as pseudohistory painted on celluloid this western is compelling and fun just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate
i just read the plot summary and it is the worst one i have ever read it does not do justice to this incredible movie for an example of a good summary read the listing at turner classic movies anyway this was one of my favorite movies as a young child my sister and i couldnt wait until every april when we could see it on tv it is one of the best horse movies of its time it is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch the romance is clean and endearing the story line is interesting and the songs are great they dont make movies like this anymore good acting and not over the top pat boone and shirley jones are at their best along with many other great character actors
i love this movie because i grew up around harness racing pat boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because unlike thoroughbred jockeys men of normal height and weight can be drivers br br yes the 1944 home in indiana is a better movie but its also a very different movie april love is light and easy to watch a feel good movie disappointing though that pat boones religiousmoral views prohibited him from ever kissing the girl quite a change from todays standard fare home in indiana with walter brennan filmed in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever burst into song captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but it requires a bigger emotional investment
i would like to comment on the movie april love its one of my all time favorites because my father nelson malone plays the horse trainer i remember distinctly when hollywood came to lexington ky where we were living at the time to make april love my dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man i talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered and lo and behold he came home wthe script how exciting is that also a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes  especially the ones shown at the amusement park its very nostalgic every april when i see the movie being shown once again and the song april love by pat boone is still played on the radio timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today wall the sex foul language and violence it would be refreshing to see more movies like april love come back into focus
having ran across this film on the fox movie channel on a lazy friday afternoon i can think of no better way to spend a lazy friday evening then putting in my two cents worth especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it doesnt every movie good or bad deserve more than four comments and this movie isnt bad at allbr br the first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like april love is to remember the era from which it came in this case the late fifties films were pretty much a happy medium back then the cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television i dont know how many people were pried away from the boob tube to see this one but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutesbr br teen idol pat boone plays nick conover a young teen sent to live with his aunt henrietta jeanette nolan and uncle jed arthur oconnell out in the country after being put on probation for stealing a car it seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son jed jrso uncle jed seems has lost his zest for living aunt henrietta is hoping that nick being on the farm will somehow bring jed out of his doldrums story lines like this being what they are jed and nick dont really care for each other too much of course jed then proceeds to meet up with the neighbors fran dolores michaelsand liz shirley jonestempleton immediately jed develops a crush on fran and of course i dont have to tell you that liz develops a crush on jed then theres the matter of uncle jeds horse a trotter who has turned wild and wont let anyone handle him since the death of jed jr you could probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own seeing as how there are no real surprises doesnt matter though youll enjoy yourself anywaybr br once you get over the image of squeaky clean pat boone as a supposedly bad boy youll have no trouble with the rest of the film considering that boone does turn in a surprisingly good performance as nick certainly the role doesnt require much depth but still its a nicely done job when you would least expect it as jed arthur oconnell is the perfect choice for the role in the early going he is unreachable and cold but as he slowly warms up to nick we see that hes really a pretty good guy jeannette nolan is a lot of fun as henrietta who is constantly playing the part of mediator between jed and nick shirley jones takes a break from rodgers and hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents as liz shes gorgeous to look at great to listen to and quite funny at times dolores michaels as fran who is a bit more on the wild side is equally entertainingbr br the best thing about april love is that there is not a true mean conniving character of any sort on the screen not one true villain in the whole thing everybody is so darn likable you cant help but enjoy the film i truthfully find it quite refreshing sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends think of it as the old andy griffith show with musical numbers a little more plot and wide screen technicolor the songs are a mixed bag with the title song april love being the best of them another thing i really liked is that they didnt fall back on using blue screen backdrops during the horse racing sequences and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it as a matter of fact youll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they didnt skimp in that department the chemistry between jones and boone is good best of all is how the dislike between nick and jed is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respectbr br this movie will never be confused with great cinema yet sometimes instead of going to disneyland one just needs a nice outing in the park and thats what april love isbr br my grade bbr br 
one of the best ensemble acted films ive ever seen there isnt much to the plot but the acting incredible you see the characters change ever so subtly undr the influence of the rented villa in italy and love and happiness the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you much as the villa does on all the women truly enchanted
two women sick of their controlling husbands taking a vacation in italy for a month with two other very different womenthey come back refreshed and energized in this wonderful little film by merchant  ivorybr br great scenery and the location isnt bad either seriously a very good period piece 7 of 10
it has been about 50 years since a movie has been made about romance and mysticism the only two movies i can think of is enchanted april 1992 and the enchanted cottage 1945 both movies used wonderful actors not stars in both movies all the actors gave their best romantic performancesbr br enchanted april is about four english women after wwi who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in italy while on vacation it is amazing enchanted april was made in 1992 it stands out as an enjoyable classic
busy phillips put in one hell of a performance both comedic and dramatic erika christensen was good but busy stole the show it was a nice touch after the smokers a movie starring busy which wasnt all that great if busy doesnt get a nomination of any kind for this film it would be a disaster forget mona lisa smile see home room
this was a very good film i didnt go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the acting the script and the scenery miranda richardson was fantastic and so was joan plowright they stole the show but the other actors played their parts wonderfully also very enjoyable film
it starts slowly showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april but dont give up on it nothing much happens but the time passes exquisitely and there are numerous sly jokes my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm which i find hilarious the movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word the scenery is beautiful as is polly walker and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfyingbr br the movie takes a couple of liberties with the book the biggest being with the arbuthnotbriggsdester business but i actually preferred the movies version of this it may be more sentimental but i felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story and anyway i like sentiment when its well donebr br an excellent movie especially as a date movie during lousy weather
i only watched this because it starred josie lawrence who i knewbr br from whose line is it anyway the wacky british improvisationalbr br comedy show i was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem it is uplifting touching andbr br romantic without being sappy or sentimental the characters arebr br all real people with real foibles fears and needs see it
this is one of those rare movies its lovely and compelling dignified and quirky a true gift i consider it a prerequisite for any trip to italy or any vacation at all because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience yup find the magic i especially loved josie lawrence as lottie wilkins but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film further the costumes if youre drawn to fashion and costumes are extraordinarily well done i just wish theyd release it on dvd because im wearing my tape version out br br absolutely well worth your time just make sure to settle in to watch it without any interruptions
nice character development in a pretty cool milieu being a male im probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start it isnt as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters each has their own thing that they contend with once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didnt go for cheap comedy when it could have it didnt try to pound a lesson into us the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people
two thirds of nearly 2000 imdb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes was this a record or merely a faulty vcr although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination but for some reason i imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it my mind was changed by elizbeth von arnims original book my wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things but i gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing although in no way syrupy and was also very well written i realised my wife would enjoy watching the film and so decided to buy her the videotape i am now very glad that i did and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful premussolini italian atmosphere the story is set in the immediate post ww1 period and starts with two married london ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together away from their families in a rented villa in italy force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses not only between these four very disparate mature ladies but also with the occasional male visitor if you want action thrills dramatic sex scenes natural or manmade disasters or harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you but imdb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch and if you care to give it a try you may as i did come to rank it among your much loved filmsbr br it is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which i am already familiar in many cases i find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that i actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book effectively unrolled before my eyes perhaps italy itself has some part in this the last time i had this experience was when i was watching tales from boccaccios decameron on tv generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events this works very well although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story great credit is due to the director mike newell and all members of the cast particularly those well known british actresses who play the four principal ladies
i absolutely loved this movie i am not even sure what particularly about it but i think it was wonderful and should be available for dvd the women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the villa in italy the actors in my opinion did an excellent job the characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work there is humor drama and relationship issues all in good time this requires 10 lines but i just cant think of any more to say so i will just rattle on until i get 10 lines so sorry about this what else can i possibly say it has been a long time since i last saw it i am looking forward to view again but it isnt available
enchanted april is a tone poem an impressionist painting a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words it has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out i continue to wait albeit less patiently for the film to come out in dvd format apparently i am not alonebr br if parent company amazons listings are correct there are many people who want this title in dvd format many people want to go to italy with this cast and this script many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries the cast is spectacular the cinematography and direction impeccable the film is a definite keeper many have already asked please add our names to the list

the true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way note that this change need not be positive or beneficial at the endbr br by that measure enchanted april is a resounding success as a film in general it succeeds quite wellexcellent ensemble cast welldeveloped characters you come to care about wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations in short the film is well enchanting although all the performances are firstrate three must be mentionedjosie lawrence jim broadbent and joan plowright it says something when miranda richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast most highly recommended particularly if you are a romantic at heart further deponent saith not
i liked this movie a lot it really intrigued me how deanna and alicia became friends over such a tragedy alicia was just a troubled soul and deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot my only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things other than that it was great
my alltime favorite movie oscarcaliber work by everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera the screenplay is perfect and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way unlike the novel the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment it is josie lawrences best work by far and transformed my opinion of joan plowright having watched this movie at least 50 times i can find no fault in it the music by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel
this is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life the pacing the camera work the emotion the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see it isnt easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted the only flaw i can see about this film is that it wasnt captured in a more technically perfect film format it deserved toddao technicolor and the very finest sound format availablean intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter the gorgeous italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard as it is it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film i cant stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite the transformations of the characters from contained tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and i really should recommend it more oftenbr br the casting is perfect the mood is perfect the acting is above reproach it is a film about middle age and the choices people makeit is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you if you dont get it perhaps you havent lived enough or something else is wrong with you
this is what i call a growth movie every character is different and better at the end and its all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a tub of love josie lawrence who is best known as a comedienne really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes even the men in this film go from being selfcentered to better men the book stayed very true to the novel which is a plus in my book since i am a librarian the scenery breathtaking and the message of love genuine
i first saw this movie back in the early 90s when it was first released room with a view was also newly out enchanted april had so much more to offer i found it much more real and earthy the characters more believable for being normal by the end of the film i felt the same as i did when i first saw the bbc production of pride and prejudice i was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation peace liberty or love you get a sense throughout that italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting but in the heat of the spring in april everyones lives loosen and unravel in line with the victorian corsets and are slowly rebuilt to everyones satisfaction what a little gem of a film how come it isnt more well known
this is the kind of movie england can do in its sleep and thats meaning it as a compliment because of the success of very british comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the twentieth century most notably adaptations of e m forster novels this very merchantivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992 it was an exceptional year for actress miranda richardson having appeared as the wife of jeremy irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in damage and as the ira terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in the crying game here she plays a quiet serene type of woman in rose arbuthnot one who with josie lawrence who plays lottie wilkins embarks on a trip that is filled with selfdiscovery they are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies one caroline dester played by the enigmatic polly walker who resembles a very vamp louise brooks and not just in the style of hair she wears and mrs fisher joan plowright this foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it but this is fine its the movie it wants to be alfred molina and jim broadbent then relatively new to american audiences fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters and all in all mike newell makes with his movie a living thing of nearmagical elements full of quiet moments and wonder
i first saw enchanted april about five years ago i loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following christmas its about two women who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april leaving their humdrum lives behind them they are very sad women at the outset of the film and you cant help but root them on as they plan this getaway with two other women they invite along to share the expenses this is perhaps the most feel good movie i have ever seen it pure and simple with no car chases no animosities and no deaths it was made with care and in very good taste you cannot help but smile all through it  except when youre crying happy tears
one of my all time favourite films ever just beautiful full of human emotion wit humour intelligence the story grows as does the lesson of life just a wonderful film in so many waysbr br the cast are also fantasic a great selection of the finest british talent around i loved them all for every diverse element brought into the filmbr br italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this  everything about this film worksbr br  i love it 
this is one of the best movies it is one of my favorites a movie with good acting the story is very sensitive and touching good camera work alsobr br the names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the american star list however they give equal or better performances than the top of the listbr br it is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love romance friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kickbox their way to save the worldbr br if you dont like this movie then you have no heart or feelings then go watch a sports movie there is no killing or horror here see the movie it is a must th
i think this movie is absolutely beautiful and im not referring only to the breathtaking scenery its about two unhappy english housewives who decide to rent an italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home lives in the end four women total rent the place together all with different personalities and different reasons for being there in this magically beautiful place they all find the peace theyre longing for and interestingly that peace comes from inward reflections and resolutions more so than without i also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed out kindness and understanding the acting is a joy to watch in itself i especially love the characters of lottie josie lawrence and lady caroline polly walker
for anyone whos judged others at first meeting here is the perfect tutorial on depth of character the grumpy old lady has a soft thoughtful heart  and needs new friends the flighty unsure ditsy dame who makes inappropriate uncomfortable comments  sees deep into your soul and has pure love for all the cold prim proper neglected wife has passion simmering that could boil over at any minute  given the right setting the perfect beauty  rich sweet partying pursued by throngs  wants peace quiet and love without possessiveness br br by taking the time to look beyond the surface you will find treasures in everyday life from the least expected sources all it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment
when i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick i was wrong this movie sends a powerful message about judging others i was deeply moved everyone i have encountered i have recommended this movie to no one has come back saying it was bad busy also did a great job with her role in this film i dont know much about her acting career but wow they way she pulled off the end of this fill was greatbr br at the beginning it was a little slow but after she went to the hospitalwow the movie picks up again i have no idea why this movie hasnt been spoken of in the movie world my wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised morebecause it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half
im biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of italy  in my opinion the most romantic country in the world unfortunately the movie was rather short unusually so for a period piece and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect however the excellent story makes up for it the four ladies embark on a muchneeded relaxing vacation with problems on their minds over the course of the movie they realize their problems and begin fixing them they believe san salvatore the castle they stay in has an enchanting effect on people its a tub of love says lottie wilkins you can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant as the italian seaside works its magic on thembr br all their problems and their solutions are plausible the actresses were great the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale all in all a 1010 movie for me
if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to with conversation character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new better and different those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing directing and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england other days other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment made in 1992 with alfred molina joan plowright polly walker josie lawrence jim broadbent miranda richardson and michael kitchens in the major roles under the brush stroke direction of mike newell these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painters eye reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character and the viewer too an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us
my child my sister dream br br how sweet all things would seem br br were we in that kind land to live together br br and there love slow and long br br there love and die among br br those scenes that image you that sumptuous weatherbr br charles baudelaire br br based on the novel by elizabeth von arnim enachanted april can be described in one sentence  it takes place in the early 1920s when four london women four strangers decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april it is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that enchanted april  an ultimate feel good movie is perfection of its genre lovely and sunny tender and peaceful kind and magical it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever this is the movie that actually affected my life i watched it during the difficult times when i was lost unhappy and very lonely when i had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself it helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible i had promised to myself then that no matter what i would pull myself out of misery and selfpity and i would appreciate every minute of life  with its joy and its sadnessi promised myself that i would go to italy and later that year i did and i was not alonebr br charming enchanting and heartwarming enchanted april is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love this little film is a diamond of highest quality
i always tell people that enchanted april is an adult movie with no cussing no sex and no violence one might think of it as the ultimate chick flick but i bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who love it too dont invite the kids though this movie is very lowkeybr br seeing enchanted april is a very healing experience the sound track and gorgeous scenery along with the ladies gentle manners bring to mind the peace and beauty of a preraphaelite paintingbr br lest anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie i will paraphrase a line i heard once on saturday night live and say that my two favorite movies are the deer hunter and enchanted april
had a bad day dog bit the mailman car wouldnt start people got on your nerves then refresh yourself with a delightful experiencebr br two women decide to pool their resources in answer to an ad for a months rental of a villa in italy due to financial circumstances two other women join them two have humdrum marital lives one is an elderly woman who prefers to live in the past the fourth is a wealthy and beautiful woman wholly jaded by lifebr br as the spell of the villa permeates their spirits each grows in her own way and is uplifted in her outlook this also changes the people in their lives who have visited them as they leave you know the magic of the villa will remain with themand you will find your outlook altered for the better a delightfully uplifting movie
magic isnt too strong a word for the spell this film weaves you find yourself relaxing and seeing others in a more benevolent light any movie that has that civilizing an effect on viewers deserves serious attention seldom are we soaked in beauty like this as if that werent enough its funny performances are without exception extraordinary but special mention must be made of the miraculous miranda richardson and the superb josie walker  both open like rosesbr br why isnt this film on dvd it deserves to live forever
this is a lovely spiritrestoring movie from the use of the actual villa that inspired elizabeth arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting every choice was perfectly right the quiet joy of this film doesnt stale after repeated viewings josie lawrence miranda richardson polly walker and joan plowright seem to have been born to play these parts i would dearly love to see enchanted april released on dvd in a widescreen format
this program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy i cant get it out of my head i find as i get older i am drawn to the wrinklies who get things done and these four are excellent in their endeavors some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our pc world wed never be able to do it in real life i always learn something from the shows but if you like mystery drama comedy and a little forensic work youll love this show it reminds me of quincy me in one way and barney miller in another the way they work and interreact with each other they screw up a lot but they get the job done and thats what counts
my wife kate and i absolutely loved the series and cant wait for the next one hopefully there is a sequel i would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it maybe because i am old and grey and still interested in life if anyone has the full lyrics please send thembr br of course one big reason why my wife and i liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually its great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience the human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the showbr br this series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated on a par with some of our other favourites spooks and hustle
this is the best series of its type ive seen all year i cant help thinking its just my luck  a series i love gets 6 episodes and more next year and the constant stream of cookiecutter cop shows get never ending episodesbr br i think the reasons new tricks succeeds are many the scripts are good and the mix of characters superb the acting is top flight and the blend of comedy and drama works a treat the stories arent all that memorable but thats not the reason i watch shows like this one br br the theme song is a favourite and we were disappointed to find it isnt available in any published edition great stuff bbc a triumph of sense over sexappeal aside from the young constable nobodys there as eyelolly and even if he is he can still act
home room was a great movie if youve ever had drama in your life it keeps you wanting to see more wondering what the secret alicia is hiding i think i watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest plus i usually dont cry over movies but this one made me cry each time i wish i could find more movies like that one all in all i thought it was a great movie the more you watch of it the more you become part of it the very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma because it had her daughters name on it my heart felt as if it had shattered just then and how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadnt gotten hers yet i loved it so much
this is a wonderful new crime series bringing together three old stalwarts of british television denis waterman james bolam and alun armstrong as retired detectives brought back to help clear up old cases under the leadership of younger careerfocused amanda redman the three quirky irritable old cops make a brilliant team applying twentyyear old detection methods in a police force which has moved a long way on since then  sometimes with effect at other times to the horror of their senior officers the three are portrayed sympathetically warts and all there are splendid comic scenes and some very moving ones as each of the three has to come to terms with growing old and the legacy of their pastsbr br at the end of the first sixpart series we are promised a further series next year each of the characters had developed widower james bolam cannot come to terms with his wifes untimely death lothario denis waterman is learning to accept his role as grandfather and even obsessive alun armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past  and keep taking the medication while amanda redman has to face the alltoofamiliar conflict between having a life and a career the story lines have been interesting if rather heavily dependent on the wonders of dnatesting but it is the interplay of four of britains finest actors which has made the series unmissable
being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdbbr br its your basic who done it thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the standardbr br to me it was worth watching more than once so ill give it an 8 on imdb
the luzhin defence is in the foreground a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant turturro who becomes consumed by the game and in the background via flashbacks his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest watson and former mentor wilson respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of italys lake como and the intensity of high chess play an excellent film for those into period dramas the auteurs euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film
of course the plot script and especially casting are strong in the film so many fine things to see one aspect i liked especially is the idea of the antagonistluzhinis turturrosexmentor working his evil on the sidelines his chess opponentan italian dandy in three piece and caneturns out to be a real gent and a truly fine chess player to his credit the opponent nobly goes along with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship posthumously luzhin has taken a flyer out a windowsad but so releasing to himby way of the unstable genius widow emily watson in death then because of the gallantry of an honorable chess master luzhins defence which he worked out in a late moment of lucidity is allowed to be played the italian gent commends the play and calls it brilliant talk about a dramatic end game
i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering her eyes are the mirror to his soul and what gentle and beautiful eyes they arebr br those who take things literally will find marleen gorris poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded
marlene gorris has established herself as one of the worlds great directors this sensitive visually beautiful film is based on a story by vladimir nabokov and captures well that writers dark irony john turturro gives what i consider to be his finest performance i am usually not a fan of his and emily watson is brilliant as well well worth seeing
this was an exteremely good historical drama john turturro is excellent as the tortured genius luzhin and brilliantly portrays the characters manic affectations such as his strange dancing emily watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover nataliabr br the relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by gorris and familiar nabokov preoccupations such as eternal innocence ie lolita are evident in this film i think i will now go on to read the novel it was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye brilliant movie
this film is one of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best the scenario is based on the novel by vladimir nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant br br the photography of the film is excellent as is the acting of both turturro and watson turturro definitely gives his best performance to date proving hes worth much more than what we thought watson also performs brilliantlybr br the story is about a phenomenal chess player turturro which is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life the film is presented in a non linear time with multiple flashbacks of luzhins childhood through those the complex character of luzhin is described br br i have nothing more to say but to suggest this film to anyone
the literary genius of vladimir navokov is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice the director puts us in check mate with the story of alexander an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted she meets alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket a magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day the mother alarmed telegrams the husband he arrives and questioning alexander we get these fades to the past ala godfather ii where we see young alexander a child prodigy he is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums thinking alexander reached his peak abandons him but becomes legend the old teacher returns causing harm trying to give victory to an old rival of alexander in a serious chess game where world chess champion victory is one way to immortality the chess clock ticks match time ends to conclude the next day that day is nastasyas wedding the old teacher interferes and alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown nastasya holding her stomach and looking thru her loves coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves though the film unfortunately sways from its russian roots its low back cut dresses are lovely alexander plays his role sublimelythe director underestimated her audience we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of the luzhin defense is after trading queens isolate the opponents king with your 3 paws  king sacrificing the castle for mate nastasya is a great match but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her the luzhin defense elegantly gives navokov honor the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed
the storyline was rather interesting but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughtsbehavior more extreme than necessary also i think something went wrong in the casting john turtorro doesnt really satisfy me playing a semiautistic chess player not to speak of the italian player motives werent very much outlined eitherbr br 
just finished watching this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time picked it up one night previously viewed at blockbuster and absolutely loved it ive shown it to 4 people so far and they have enjoyed it as well avoid of all the hollywood glamour special effects and stress on the shock factor this independent film by paul f ryan hits the nail on the head in dealing with the after affects of traumatic situations taking place after a high school shooting two characters alicia busy philipps and deanna erika christensen form an unlikely bond alicia the girl with the stone heart the goth who has a pessimistic attitude to life assists deanna to overcome the issues of life and death and living in the aftermath meanwhile deanna attempts to help alicia to see some of the softness and light in the world again not stressing on the shocking event of the shooting but on the interpersonal relationships amongst those who survived it sets this movie apart despite its lowbudget and short filming time this movie is far from cheesy ryan pays respect to a situation he has never endured and attempts to delve into the human psyche with an amazing up and coming actress philipps adds the necessary dramatics to the dialogue and overall feel for the film and christensen helps to balance out the doom and gloom feeling this movie may have overall i recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and learning more about it i also suggest the documentary its a girls world put out by cbc in 2004 which deals with the topic of social bullying comparing and contrasting two groups of girls one in montreal quebec and the other in victoria british columbia the group of friends and acquaintances of dawn marie wellesley a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied
as a psychiatrist specialized in trauma i find this film a beautiful shown example of a severe psychic trauma even a trauma it not only explains the enormous difficulties those people have to cope wither but that even love is sometimes not enough but she tries
this movie stars emily watson of breaking the waves fame this movie about one mans obsession takes place at a resort where a chess tournament is being held a chess master arrives and shortly after falls madly in love at first sight with a woman played by emily watson she falls for this oddball of a man who is obsessed with chess this is all at the dismay of her mother who is far more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman a proper gentleman her mother feels that this is just a passing fancy for the young woman as she has a tendency to take in odd animals and such what ensues is mostly a journey through the mans psyche it tells the story of how his past is closely tied with his present emily watson is amazing in this as well as the actor who plays the main character it is definitely slow but is well worth the watching the ending was even satisfying 
this movie was well done in all respects the acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack which i purchased because it was so moving it is my all time favorite movie ahead of eastwoods white hunterblack heart this movie is simply the bestbr br cheers zuf
dont know how this missed award nominations great film certainly of the calibre of beautiful mind great acting photography script and drama i cant imagine anyone not being entranced by this film
not having read nabokov and knowing nothing about chess i could only view the luzhin defence as a movie br br it works really well as one of my favorite genres sports romances the chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in say searching for bobby fischer in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be requiring thought preparation stamina and planning i particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipatedbr br through the feminist director maureen gorris of antonia emily watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with john turturros fairly onenote absentminded intense chess geniusbr br the settings in italy and hungary are beautifulbr br originally written 5272001
once again proving his amazing versatility john turturro plays the introspective russian chess genius preparing for a comeback tournament and forging an unlikely relationship with a gadabout fellow resident emily watson at a 1920s italian hotel they fall in loveto the horror of her socialmountaineering mother geraldine jamesa wonderful love story whose gloss of chess might make it appear cerebralbut in spite of its origins in a nabakov story it certainly is not the romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands downjohn turturro having appeared in barton fink o brotherwhere art thou the big lebowski proves that he is not dependant on coen bros films to assert his stature
a brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there on itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story so there is more there is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the playerbr br this film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely its easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film the added effect of the tournament is very good too and creates a nice tension settingbr br i have no idea of the strength of the chess players as i dont play the game myself but it looks nice and believable all in all most of the film goes down very easily it is also forgotten again very easily though so its nice to watch but nothing more than thatbr br 7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place
hi all i am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6 i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess but hopefully not as much as the central character in this filmbr br in this film the central character reflects a real chess player called curt von bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924 he is famous for a game he played against steinitz where a beautiful combination was played by steinitz instead of resigning he simply walked out of the tournament hall never to returnbr br the social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments chess i suppose is a very big sacrifice and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life a major example of this is the chess legend bobby fischer although a genius he was also very disturbed in many waysbr br in the film a world championship match is depicted as between an italian grandmaster and luzhin the format is a knockout which actually the world governing body of fide has sometimes employed as a format itself  going from 128 players to just 2 in the final but this was a group knockout  which also depicts a realistic format where the winners of each group play against each otherbr br the position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself in fact i have done a youtube video about it for you to explore the winning combination in detail  enjoy httpukyoutubecomwatchvxzptdtphwdm best wishes tryfon
im rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in luzhins game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final despite the use of jonathan speelman as consultant chess expert luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move in between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after luzhins combination culminating in a queen sacrifice his rook on d1 is still pinned by blacks rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1 thus he is unable to play the purported mating move rd1d8 which would be illegal  but hes shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience
emily watsons natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character i have ever seen on a screen she is the queen of this film beyond all doubt or is she transmuted to the king the internecine weaving of the chess games and the families struggles for control power and victory is stunning just as the chess masters in the film do the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once but all weave into either major or minor patterns the period the costumes and imagery of early 20th century italys lake district is captured magnificently not a single square of space is wastedbr br so many brilliant scenes abound i cannot recount them all i recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice possibly a week apart because you cant possibly capture all the poetry within a 64square yet multidimensional framework in one setting br br i did not read nabakovs book but to try an analogy of my own what i am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetryasgame movie barry levinsons the natural it totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of bernard malamuds fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely american well the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing russian and italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment the true story here is that games are zerosum there is a winner and a loser unless both contestants draw but in life and especially in the context of our immortal souls we are only limited by those constraints and lifes conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit br br pure love as personified by emily watsons natalia can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from itbr br this is a magnificent movie 1010
it breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be its very underrated people forgot what movies are really about nowadays they only think about bum bum movies which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends like transformers movies which are oriented with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline its the kind of a movie what i despite most of course it is fun watching greatly made cgis but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of moviesbr br i honestly think that performance was excellent especially busy philipps alongside with erika christensen and victor garberwhom i respect made this movie an oscar worth emotional performance by busy philipps was astonishing its such a shame we wont see oscar in her hands which she deserves
the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game so many people have seen this film and just dont get it and i dont understand why while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me i will try to explain this without any spoilers but be forewarned i do talk about things that happen in the moviebr br  possible spoilers  be forewarnedbr br his is a life of large moves versus small moves he chooses natalia to be his queen and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy listen closely to that descriptionbr br when someone asks him a question he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves the flashbacks are beautifully lit by the way the flashbacks are quite interesting as well for they give not only his point of view as a child but the point of view of the other character as well its stunningbr br various characters become either his helpers or his enemies pawns bishops and knights their actions enlightening you as to whos side they are on even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on beautifully donebr br i will not comment more on what happens to the character of luhzin but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the endbr br this film is constantly working on many levels which is why i endorse it it was a treat and a joy to watchbr br if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as piecesbr br 
this is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great maybe this is because gorris takes nabokovs initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which dignifies him more than the nabokovs onebr br the only thing in the movie which i dont like is the influence of valentinovs on luzhins destiny i cant imagine nabokov creating a person like valentinov and giving him so great influence on novels argument
this is a poem on film wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry it captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly italys lake district in the twenties its a love story with a twist the characters are unique and believable the settings are deliciously exotic some of the scenes  the funeral boat in the fog  the high long shot of the chess table in the centre of an intricately patterned tile floor  are beautiful images and rather than the mandatory happy ending this story has a bitter sweet one if film is an art this is close to a masterpiecebr br 
very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win itjohn toturro plays a psychologically challenged man nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces the game validates him as a person when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashioneven the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existenceit makes you wonder if there other luzons out there who obsess about the gamei am sure they areif you are a chess enthusiast it wont hurt to watch itits an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed wellit achieves its objectivesunfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel
alexandr sascha luzhin john turturro is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an italyhosted tournament his brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life natalia emily watson is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother vera geraldine james to scope out possible marriage partners vera leans toward a handsome count but astonishingly natalia is more fascinated by sascha whom she met on a walk sascha too is taken with natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting but with the concentration that sascha must give to the chess matches and with other happenings in his past still causing problems will he win the heart of natalia oh and can he become the chess champion also this is a lovely film based on a novel by nabokov the acting is amazing with watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and turturro utter perfection as the shy awkward chess enthusiast james gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well as for the look of the film it could not be better the scenery is of the putyoureyeout variety the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause yes the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks at times making it a film not everyone will appreciate then too the ending is bittersweet however if you love romance period pieces great acting knockout scenery or the fine art of motion picture creation dont miss this one you will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms
the luzhin defence is a good film with fine central performances but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmakers craft shines through it felt through most of the film that the characters just helped to push the narrative along marlene gorris could perhaps have examined the psyche of luzhin rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of othersbr br adapting literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task especially a novel written in the early 20th century this film does not go deeply enough into the relationship between luzhin and natalia natalias rift with her mother comes across a churlish disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flashpoint in the film i felt that i was put through luzhins torment and eventual tragic end without being given the pleasure of having his unusual and complex personality unravelled however this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one
the luzhin defence is a movie worthy of anyones time it is a brooding intense film and kept my attention the entire time john turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender eccentric chess grandmaster and emily watson is spellbinding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected russian family the chemistry between watson and turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story all in all this movie is one of the best indepth looks at the life of a chess grandmaster and turturro and watson add a whole nonmainstream noncliche feel to the film most people will come out of the theater thinking and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories
a movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story the luzhin defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty depth and characterbr br 	it gives john turturro what is probably his finest role to date thank goodness they didnt give it to ralph fiennes who would have murdered it similarly emily watson shows the wealth of her experience from her outstanding background on the stage to reach the tortured chess master turturro her character has to display intelligence as well as a womans love watson does not portray beautypageant sexuality but she brings to her parts a selfawareness that is alluringbr br 	in a chance meeting between natalia watson and luzhin she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing  a specially crafted piece that we realize later in the film has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations later as their love affair develops she subtly likens dancing to chess luzhin has learnt to dance but never with a partner she encourages him to lead her with bold brilliant moves and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best and also realize himself as her loverbr br 	this is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment emotionally and intellectually or so we are led to believe  certainly within the time frame natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and motherbr br 	the italian sets are stunning the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent moviegoer yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit and most deservedly so chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chessplayer that the characters existed although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting
part of the enjoyment that i took from this film stemmed from the fact that i knew nothing more about it than that it starred john turturro and emily watson 2 reasons enough to watch was a period piece and involved chess everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected i shant therefore give away much more suffice to say that turturro is magnificent as an eccentric obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and em matches him step for step as the strongminded woman who is drawn to him its about love and obsession rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour became totally compelling and i defy anyone to secondguess the ending
walking home after the film i was humming the familiar waltz music that natalia and alexandre were dancing to ive heard that before  where ah from kubricks eyes wide shut track 2 got it just as i arrived at the door its waltz no 2 from jazz suite no 2 composed by dimitri shostakovich performed here by the city of prague philharmonic orchestra yes i went and picked up the soundtrack from towers what a treat the film score by alexandre desplat was fulfilling  there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz its not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score reminds me of favorite scores by maurice jarre ennio morricone beginning notes of track 6 have traces of nuovo cinema paradiso georges delerue and john barry there are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings celeste piano and harp br br emily watson and john turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance the love story their intimate connection is very much between alexandre and natalia  his childlike yet tormenting inner world and her generous and bold understanding of him  a relationship alone to them both director marleen gorris of antonias line 1996 academy awards best foreign language film from the netherlands gave us a quietly sensitive film  not without its unsettling human conflicts intrigues obsessions family strives lovingness and respect the frontend subject is the mindgame and mathematical logic of chess beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920s cinematography captures the serene beauty of lake como in northern italy near the swiss borderbr br i highly recommend the soundtrack if you dont feel like going to the movies alexandre desplats lyrical film score of the luzhin defence is complete
im from belgium and therefore my english writing is rather poor sorry for thatbr br this is one of those little known movies that plays only once on tv and than seems to vanishes into thin air i was browsing through my old vhs video collection and came across this title i looked it up and it had an imdb score of more than 710 thats pretty decentbr br i must admit that its a very well put together movie and thats why im puzzled this is the only film made by this director how come he didnt make lots of films after this rather good one someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie ha ha  br br anyway i really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this one please
obsession comes in many flavors and exists for a variety of reasons for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder but for others it may be an avenue of survival lack of nurturing combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone and in extreme cases the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing and as we discover in the luzhin defence directed by marleen gorris a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem and in fact may actually exacerbate the situation obsession it seems has no prejudice or preference moreover it gives no quarterbr br 	at an italian resort in the 1920s alexander luzhin john turturro is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament the winner of which will be the world champion luzhin is a master of the game but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him rather it is his obsession that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family so luzhin is a genius with an achilles heel a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament that man is valentinov stuart wilson luzhins former mentor who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to luzhinbr br 	valentinov is an unwelcomed disconcerting presence to luzhin and once again life threatens to overwhelm him not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament turati fabio sartor against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life his feelings for a young woman hes just met at the resort natalia emily watson and genius though he may be dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace as well the curse of his entire lifebr br 	to tell luzhins story gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess and as his background is established it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life for the scenes of his childhood gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into and underlies the present more pastoral setting of the resort the transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled and with the pace gorris sets it makes for a riveting yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well she also underplays the menace produced by the presence of valentinov concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film making luzhins tragedy all the more believable and unsettlingbr br 	the single element that makes this film so memorable however is the affecting performance of john turturro for this film to work luzhin must be absolutely believable one false or feigned moment would be disastrous as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately it doesnt happen however and the film does work because the luzhin turturro creates is impeccably honest and truetolife he captures luzhins genius as well as his inadequacies and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real its a performance equal to if not surpassing geoffrey rushs portrayal of david helfgott in shine and when you compare his work here with other characters hes created from sid lidz in unstrung heroes to pete in o brother where art thou to al fountain in box of moonlight you realize what an incredible range turturro has as an actor and what a remarkable artist he truly isbr br 	as natalia emily watson is excellent as well turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to luzhin watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective most importantly because of the detail she brings to her performance it makes her accelerated relationship with luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story you have but to look into watsons eyes to know that the feelings shes conveying are real its a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actorbr br 	the supporting cast includes geraldine james vera christopher thompson stassard peter blythe ilya orla brady anna mark tandy luzhins father kelly hunter luzhins mother alexander hunting young luzhin and luigi petrucci santucci well crafted and delivered the luzhin defence is an emotionally involving film presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon mans inhumanity to man we dont need a movie of course to tell us that there is cruelty in the world but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change and to make a difference in the lives of those around us i rate this one 910 br br  br br  br br 
take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where theyll be tempted by 26 singles this was the premise of the show simple yet outrageous  funny leave it to fox to throw morality out the window  let the debauchery flow it was like a reallife version of melrose place the good thing about the show is that it wasnt about people conniving  manipulating each other for a cash prize it was about lust  temptation pure and simple  the ultimate test for a relationshipbr br people either loved the show or hated it it was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident you know you shouldnt watch but you cant help but look drama aside there was a lot of eye candy
let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice i do not consider myself a trekker or trekkie those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors the acting was better than average but the plot held no surprises they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation now as to the historical errors if you call them that the first capitan to pilot the enterprise was commander april then capt pike jim kirk etc according to a statement made by both riker and kirk we dicovered the klingons and educated them and gave them the technology thats the reason a prime directive was created but like i said these are no reason to discredit this fine series i hope the plots will get deeper and then special effects can take a backseat
i have been a star trek fan for as long as i can remember when they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series i was very excitedbr br the premiere of enterprise was well worth the wait it was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters the nx01 enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to lovebr br scott bakula was just superior as captain jonathan archer jolene blalock gave a commanding performance as subcommander tpol that it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us into the great history of starfleetbr br enterprise looks like its going to be a good series well worth watching and i recommend that watch it
this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series it has a down to earthkind of feel with darker and less plaggy scenographybr br the characters need some more time to develop but they have potential one thing that is fairly disappointing with all star trek series really is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else earth has stopped war famine etcbr br  the female characters here are two subcommander tpol who is vulcan and communications officer hoshi who is human hoshi is quite wimpy and tpol is made to be a vulcan babebr br  some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american as opposed to the more international feel of the tngcrew but creates interesting dynamicsbr br  a very good pilot though for a very good series
br br there is star trek canon  lots of it from canon we know the history of the future advances in technology events places first contacts with new beings names dates etcbr br enterprise pretty much disregards much of st canon an unfortunate fact for long time serious fans as one i assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of tos and retro back from there  but nobr br the phase pistols like much of the technology look much more modern than found in tos an old style starfleet laser gun a slow gold speckle transporter effect  thats what i expected to see also i did not expect to hear pure beepbased sound effects similar to tng but far apart from tos sound effects br br in the earliest view of tos the original pilot the cage we see a starfleet with a more formal military aspect  a bit of old earth navy with enterprise we see a shocking disregard for rank there is more military code in the cartoon star blazers than in enterprisebr br it is fine that captain archer is unsure about the needs of the universe quite unlike kirk who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice but inside enterprise everyone seems like an equal unprofessional unsure more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any st series  and that says a lotbr br the casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vesselbr br enterprise looks to show us a mostly fun warmfuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic bold gritty highrick exploration of spacebr br i would have selected adrian paul to play the captain and an older human to be the doctor still i liked the actors for the most part linda park an outstanding ballroom dancer from boston college is sure to develop nicely the characters making up the crew seem to be thoughtfully createdbr br enterprise begins its run stronger than did the past three star trek series lets hope for a good future
enterprise is the entertainment but it is also the forefront of science fiction and a positive outlook for tomorrow with gratitude and respect mr berman and mr braga i wish you well thank you both for your service to trekbr br enterprise is what trek is about
call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series if you havent had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series you should definitely watch this one perhaps more compelling than that of voyagers caretaker which launched the series with cpt janeway archers adventures are completely different yet strangely familiarthe music is catchy too no true scifi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek episodeand these installments make the wait worthwhile
this is what i was expecting when star trek ds9 premiered not to slight ds9 that was a wonderful show in its own right however it never really gave the fans more of what they wanted enterprise is that show while having a similarity to the original trek it differs enough to be original in its own ways it makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again and that was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved another ingredient to success was the relationships that evolved between the crew members viewers really cared deeply for the crew enterprise has much promise in this area as well the chemistry between bakula and blalock seems very promising while sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch i feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical i think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even we get some very interesting ideas and television also we should note the performances blalock is very convincing as vulcan tpol and bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character that delivers a great performance the rest of the cast delivered good performances also my only gripes are as follows the theme its good its different but a little to light hearted for my liking we need something a little more grand doesnt have to be orchestral maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice and my one other complaint they sell too many adds they could fix this by selling less ads or making all shows two parters otherwise well end up seeing the shows final act getting wrapped up way too quickly as was one of my complaints of voyager
the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek a dose of realistic flawed personalities the utopian characters of the next generation got tiring they were so noble as to be unbelievable i also like the subplot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two though i dont think it would work in the time frame of the show the only negatives that jumped out at me were the quick cut off the ending at 2 hours feel of the end which is common among many of the trek shows the second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes it was out of place a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the preteen audience with some skin but its not my job to make the show profitable so oh wellbr br lets see how the next episode does
if you get it its magnificentbr br if you dont its decentbr br please understand that getting it does not necessarily mean youve gone through a school shooting there is so much more to this movie that at times the school shooting becomes insignificantbr br above all its a movie about acceptance both superficiallyof a traumatic event but also of people who are different for whatever reasonbr br its also a movie about unendurable pain and how different people endure it in this case the contrast between alicias rage and deannas obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat thankfully the audience is given credit for being human beings our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy implausibly moralistic endingbr br above and beyond that i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that yet i must admit i cried like a lost little baby during this movie there were certain things about it that hit very close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed but that is not necessarily a bad thing
futz is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the 1960s the origins of off off broadway though its not for everyone it is a genuinely brilliant darkly funny even more often deeply disturbing tale about love sex personal liberty and revenge a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our constitution the story is not about being gay though  its about love and sex that dont conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate on the surface it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig but like any great fable its not really about animals its about something bigger  stifling conformity in americabr br the stage version won international acclaim in its original production it toured the us and europe and with others of its kind influenced almost all theatre that came after it luckily we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived with the original cast and original director tom ohorgan who also directed hair and jesus christ superstar on broadwaybr br this is not a mainstream easytotake studio film  this is an aggressive unsettling glorious deeply emotional wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that youll never forget and it just might change the way you see the world
my children just happened to stop at this movie the other night and as things started to play out it really piqued my interest i had to head out for bowling league so i had them record it for me on the dvr so i could watch the rest later well i just got done watching it and the front of my shirt must be soaked after crying buckets it was an excellent movie even though i could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing and i never in a million years would have guessed the reason why alissia had gone from this beautiful girl to an antisocial goth this was probably why my shirt was soaked because ive experienced that same pain that alissia was feeling i too would not have sought out this movie but im sure glad i saw it very moving very touching great for those who love a good drama or tearjerker
busy is so amazing i just loved every word she has ever done freaks and geeks dawsons creek white chicks the smokers after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day i am a big fan of her and she has a lot of fans here in israel if someone hasnt saw is excellent movie than dont waist more time and go see it now i recommend to all of you to see all of her movies i saw busy in the late night show with conan and she was so beautiful and cute i just love her everybody who saw the movie in home room she looks very scary but in real life she is so beautiful you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine maxim she looks so good there danielle
this movie is incredible if you have the chance watch it although a warning youll cry your eyes out i do every time i see it and i own it and have watched it many times the performances are outstanding it deals with darkness and pain and loss but there is hope this movie made me look at the world differently vicarious experience according to my english teacher also if youve seen it note the interesting use of shadows and light home room is a phenomenal movie and i rate it 1010  for real  because of the excellent acting amazing plot and heartwrenching dialogue very tense very moving doesnt give all the answers but makes many good points about humankind
home room really surprised me in comparison to other movies that were written regarding columbine high school this one is the best home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town the movie focus on two opposite characters aleciabusy phillips and deannaerika christensen alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting she seems to show no emotion about it deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim alecia is forced to visit deanna at the hospital in order to graduate meanwhile the police are investigating alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen alecia and deanna are very different and do not get along at first eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends very much in the style of the breakfast club home room beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting i would recommend this film to anyone and everyone
home room deals with a columbinelike highschool shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors their trauma guilt and denialbr br spoilers the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage swat commando after shooting the high school killer the film has three protagonists the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young erika christensen and busy philippsbr br the two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensuesbr br erika christensen though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting busy philipps three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence this girl was the partbr br its a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls gus van sants elephant 2003 though good seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure  so much more a loss for an equally traumatized americabr br ten out of ten
at first i wasnt sure if i wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so i looked it up on imdb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so i thought i would give it a try expecting a movie like elephantbr br once i got past the fact that i am supposed to dislike the alicia character played excellently by busy phillips i realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between alicia and deanna alicia is so mean to deanna played by erika christensen almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting they share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progressesbr br ive just got to say how much i loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it i couldnt even get through elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the columbine tragedy this movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic busy phillips acting is off the chain that is a good thing and i would love to see her progress into some more mature roles
this is one of the most amazing stories i have ever seen br br if this film had been directed by larry clark then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first placebr br instead the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting and how it effected the victims who survivedbr br i had seen busy phillips in other films before but her performance in this movie is by far her best the only other movie that ive seen with erika christensen is swim fan which made me almost not want to watch this film but she turned in a very good performance herselfbr br this is one of the few movies i have seen that was actually able to make me cry trust me when i tell you that doesnt happen very oftenbr br home room is a beautiful film and thats all there is too it
i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen i was bored and looked through the tv and found home room and it was already in about 5 min but i got hooked it was so interesting and moving it shows what can happen in anyones life i give it a 10 more if possible the director writer and actors did an amazing job i think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it it was great drama mystery and more i cried for hours i think that the director writer should write more movies like this one i loved it i didnt even know about this movie which is sad because it was so good i wish it could go in the movies for more people to see
caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channels and was so intrigued i sought out the next showingbr br i really didnt know what to expect after reading the program summary but i came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed it also gave me as adult who attended high school in the 80s a little better insight into what our kids have to contend with these daysbr br the fact that you dont see the shooting only adds to the chillness of the plot to see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend and come to terms with the senseless shootings was at times overwhelming and will admit that i shed quite a few tears throughoutbr br on the whole not a movie that i would seek out to what however i am sure glad i did see it
while i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem i dont know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever rightbr br the story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting one of the girls is alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle thrown together by fate they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving onbr br i just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not to mention the rest of the cast my only complaint is that the dvd was sorely lacking in special features oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring but all in all a excellent movie
i came in in the middle of this film so i had no idea about any credits or even its title till i looked it up here where i see that it has received a mixed reception by your commentators im on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as i watched the beautiful and sensitive score written in a coplandesque americana style my surprise was great when i discovered the score to have been written by none other than john williams himself true he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as schindlers list but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as star wars but in my opinion what williams has written for this movie surpasses anything ive ever heard of his for tenderness sensitivity and beauty fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie and another recent score of his for catch me if you can shows still more wit and sophistication as to stanley and iris i like education movies like how green was my valley and konrack that one with john voigt and his young african american charges in south carolina and danny devitos renaissance man etc they tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening a story which cant be told often enough this one is an excellent addition to that genre
home room like zero day and elephant was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings but unlike the other two films home room focuses on two survivors not the shooters or those killed in the aftermath of a shooting making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answersbr br dont give up on this little film during the first 20 minutes it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected hill street blues episode it is lame but bear with it at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature i recommend skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenesthere is nothing here that you cant pick up from the remainder of the filmbr br like a lot of good little films this was creatively a oneman show as paul f ryan was both the writer and the director while this arrangement does not guarantee a good film it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features because the script of home room is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screenbr br ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewers sentimentality tolerance he runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey the song sarah mclaughlins sweet surrender he goes out on and the amazing editing of the final minutebr br the other strength of the film is the casting of busy phillips alicia and erika christensen deanna as the main protagonists although phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before the family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to ryan what is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie alicia to the lone shooter if they ever recut and trim the film this side story should be condensedbr br a story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and ryan could have easily steered this film into cliché and predictability but instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability only to retreat back inside themselves deannas im dying inside line just tears you aparti cant think of a moment in any other film that i felt as intensely as that one she desperately needs a connection that alicia just as desperately resists deanna only makes progress when she retreats the viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happenbr br ultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to lifebr br then again what do i know im only a child
alright this film is the representation of several things for starters this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly 9 students one student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head injuries the lead character is what several people who consider a lonergoth despite the movies stating of her not being so she seems quite mysterious but was also the only unharmed student in the victimized classroom shes questioned due to having a history of knowing the shooter and having a record of being on the phone with him the night before anyhow shes a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society yet due to some at first unexplained events she spent roughly a year out of school failing the grade she has the desire to graduate and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor the girl in the hospitalbr br these two leads are nearly entirely opposite and they are quite that on a social level while alisha is a quiet inwardly disturbed antisocial goth girl who spends her time entirely alone even though she seems to read quite often somewhat of a closetout of the closet bookworm the other girl is a rich popular bubbly girl who seems always incredibly optimistic and trapped in her own fantasy world ignoring the outside world and its realism to survive i feel both of these roles to a marvelous job of representing most cliques in the modern highschool but more importantly shows how two entirely opposite girls who know nothing of each other eventually open to each other while the injured girl learns a deep meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world alisha learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not always the best thingbr br many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things either a snobby hateful girl who wants he rest of the world to suffer as she does taking it out on an innocent girl or the story of a seemingly trapped fantasized girl who meets an outcast to society and learns not only not to judge but that she is actually perhaps one of the most intelligent people shes known in other words people may see this film as a focus on alisha teaching the other girl a lesson about life but it isnt about thatbr br this film is about several things while it is about all i have stated it is also representative of how people deal from a large lifechanging catastrophe truly this movie is not very symbolic but instead incredibly straight forward with its message as long as you arent afraid to open your mind and your heart to some emotions you may not be familiar with being portrayed so miraculouslybr br overall this film is one of the best ive ever seen the acting is brilliant the storyline and representation is deep and meaningful and the emotion flowing throughout this film will have anyone not only relating but possibly crying this film is by far heartwrenching and very impactful and if i ever believed any film could alter a persons life this would be the first that could have changed minebr br i adored this movie if you ever want a movie thats moving and impactful while incredibly entertaining and real watch this
i absolutely loved this movie i bought it as soon as i could find a copy of it this movie had so much emotion and felt so real i could really sympathize with the characters every time i watch it the ending makes me cry i can really identify with busy phillips character and how i would feel if the same thing had happened to mebr br i think that all high schools should show this movie maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing i recommend this movie to everybody and anybody especially those who have been affected by any school shootingbr br it truly is one of the greatest movies of all time
this movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny if you think of seeing this one for the shootings stay clear this one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure even the detectives are seeking the answer we all dowhy fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with yes the language is harsh at times but it suits the characters well there are some loose ends left or unanswered but all movies have these the major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents highly recommended for teens and adults
this is paul f ryans first and only fulllength feature he hasnt done anything since however he managed to get an amazing ensemble cast to portray the characters of his story i dont know when or why the idea emerged in his head but ryan wrote a screenplay which later became his own directed movie home roombr br busy philipps carries the movie on her shoulders as alicia a troubled girl the ones we always see in television series with dark hair and black clothes a package of cigarettes in the pocket weird look and disturbing eyes with makeup of course an event has occurred at her school a shooting some students have died and she saw everything now detective martin van zandt victor garber is investigating the case and as expected alicia is a suspect but the shooting is just the genesis the movie is not about the shootingbr br lying in bed in a hospital room is deanna cartwright erika christensen she is one of the survivors of the hospital the script establishes a bond between them by the school principal james pickens jr he is helping all the students to recover from the event but alicia doesnt seem to care shes isolated so the principal punishes her she needs to visit deanna every day until five o clock then the movie startsbr br i cant even describe how wonderfully written i think the movie is i can identify with the characters and the situations they live i like reality these things could happen to anyone and the things they say are totally understandable theyre growing up and trying to deal with things they havent experienced theyre doing their best without knowing it alicia when she visits deanna for the first time and deanna when she sees alicia standing in front of her are commencing a journey of that will define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life after high schoolbr br the director leads christensen and philipps through their roles very well look the contrast between them deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts no complexity inside of her mind when alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers she asks who has brought them many people deanna answers although some days later we learn theyre from her parents who come every week the parental figures are all well represented but are not as important as their sons characters deanna is lonely alicia seems mature and violent smoking cigarettes and talking roughly but after two days of visiting she finds herself coming back to the hospital every day even sleeping in deannas room all night when they both have a fight afterwards i believe deanna says why do you keep coming back alicia is lonely toobr br the ending of the movie without ruining it comes a bit disappointing its something i wasnt waiting for it eliminates some of the strength the movie has the revelation comes totally unnecessary ruining the logical climax the movie could have had it was an excellent script anyway and an excellent direction a damn fine moviebr br when it comes to erika christensen this was the role she needed to fly higher her role in traffic was impressing but this was the big step the main role maybe not many had the chance to see her in this film and thats a pity she hasnt made one false move since then she has even come out with good performances in awful movies on the other hand busy philipps who proved to be very promising in this movie what a transformation hasnt got many opportunities for other rolesbr br the same i say about paul f ryan in directing of curse and i expect he is sitting now in his computer finishing his new script im waiting for his next movie im hoping the best for all of them
this film isnt just about a school shooting in fact its never even seen but that just adds to the power this film has its about people and how they deal with tragedy i know it was shown to the students who survived the columbine shooting and it provided a sense of closure for a lot of them the acting is superb all three main actors busy phillips erika christensen and victor garber are excellent in their rolesi highly recommend this film to anyone its one of those films that makes you talk about it after you see it it provokes discussion of not only school shootings but of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy it is a tearjerker but it is well worth it and one i will watch time and time again
home room came as a total surprise not having a clue as to what it was all about it paid off big time because it doesnt hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his class mates who are the innocent victims of his rash actionsbr br paul ryan the director who is working and editing his own material is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his castbr br alicia browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school she has been away a couple of years and doesnt seem to be in the same wave length of the other students for one she is a rebel with a punk look lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students have died supposedly killed by her boyfriend alicia we realize is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life but we are not given any clues to that effectbr br what follows is the aftermath of the tragedy as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it deanna cartwright is a wealthy teen ager who shouldnt have been at the school at all when a ricochet bullet hit her she is hospitalized with more than a wound she is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares dont let her forgetbr br alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal since she doesnt cooperate with the police the head of the school wants her to see deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows alicia dislikes deanna but in a matter of days both girls will make peace we dont realize until the last sequence what really happened that horrible day in schoolbr br busy phillips makes an excellent alicia and erika christiansen is equally good as deanna victor garber james pinkins taylor holland and the rest of the cast play as an ensemblebr br the film has an intensity because its not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred which helps the tone that mr ryan wanted to give this movie
the industry dropped the ball on this the trailer does not do the movie justice and when this opened it was on a hand full of screens had people had an opportunity to see this work of mouth would have made it very successful the 2 lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters i checked this out based on the rave recommendation richard roeper or ebert and roeper in his book an example of a great film that never got fully released except on a few screens which gave it no chance to be seen some movies go to video quickly because they arent that good this is oscar worthy and its a tragedy on many levels that most will never even hear of it maybe via word of mouth it will gain a following on dvd or cable if you havent see this movie you should great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this movie it could have just been another formulaic teen movie after school special but instead it stands up well to other note worthy films girl interrupted comes to mind if you like that you will like this br br both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic even though alicia is angry and deanna is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic the movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school erica is even better in this than in traffic i hope both of these actors get more roles that utilize their talents as well and let them shine see this movie and if you like recommend to friends so it doesnt get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year this movie was buried while spiderman 2 tops records what kind of word are we living in aghhh so to make the world right again see this and recommend it
why a stupid boring crappy overrated film series like star wars gets all the hype and a truly amazing film like this one goes completely unnoticed is beyond me this movie will really open your eyes to the dark disturbing sad and scary world we live inbr br unlike the boring elephant this movie isnt one of those just a typical day until someome pulls the trigger movies this movie focuses more on what happens after the eventbr br deana played by the very hot and very talented erika christensen is a happy and healthy straighta student with great friends and a great life until she is injured on the day of the shooting by being shot in the head luckily she is not killed but is severely injured and has to be in the hospital for a while causing her to be in a lot of emotional pain in addition to the physicalbr br meanwhile alicia played by the also very gorgeous and talented busy phillips is a nasty coldhearted rebellious antisocial goth girl who doesnt have a single positive trait on her and she is unharmed when the shooting happens because it turns out she was friends with the shooter and knew he was going to do what he did which causes her to be brought into the police station and be asked some questions when she refuses to tell the cops if she knew the shooting was going to happen they constantly come by her house to try to convince her to say something and she still doesnt so the principal of the school makes her attend a funeral of one of the dead students and after she walks out on that the principal decides enough is enough and forces her to go visit deana in the hospital of course she refuses this too but the principal says that if alicia doesnt do this the cops are going to continue to try to get her to say something and so she actually goes to see herbr br the lonely traumatized and both physically and emotionally wounded deana is more than happy to have someone visit her but of course alicia is anything but happy to be seeing her deana attempts to give her a friendly welcome but of course alicia responds with nothing but harsh and hurtful comments and a harsh statement on how she is only here because she is being forced and has no intention of being friendly with her at all but sooner or later that intention will change and thats all ill say  this is truly one of the most moving movies ever as well as one of the most dark and disturbing actually i think i would tie this with american history x as equally disturbing and moving at the same timebr br warning watch this movie at your own risk it contains very graphic scenes and images excellent and criminally underappreciated movie i feel so ashamed that im pretty much the only one that knows about it
i was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start  every time i even thought going to bed something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtimebr br this movie could have been another easy slam dunk antigun film but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings and even better the movie kept on with the real life  just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie this film not only doesnt follow the formula it shows how other events often lead up to andor affect what happens afterwardsbr br i only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around antidepressant drugs more  the kids from columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time the nightmares started up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have it was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film having a relative who suffers from a mental illness i can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues and for those who think certain things couldnt happen in a hospital i dont want to tell any particulars youre dead wrong on that too  ive been there the script was so real it was amazingbr br go buy this film and show it to your teenage kids before its too late someday theyll thank you for it
fair dramalove story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new lovethe acting here is good but the film fails in cinematographyscreenplaydirecting and editingthe storyscript is only average at bestthis film will be enjoyed by fonda and de niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious levelit would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy
what a surprise two outstanding performances by the lead actresses in this film this is the best work busy phillips has ever done and the best from erika christensen since traffic this film certainly should be in oscar contention see this movie
i couldnt believe the comments made about the moviebr br as i read the awful opinions about the movie i actually wondered if you had actually viewed the same movie that i didbr br what i viewed was incredible i think the actresses and director did a fantastic job in the moviebr br i hadnt had the pleasure to see either actress previously and i couldnt have been more set back by the incredible job that they did id have to say its the most believable movie that ive seen in a long time br br what i dont see is why everyone has such a problem with deannas choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice that i dont understand its a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how it can be the actresses error i fail to see i think it was a real believable movie that i would see again and recommend opinions are what the are and its too bad that so many are so close minded i hope to see any of the actors soon i think that all played great rolesbr br busy philipps will be the highest paid actress someday and i hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her you go girl
i just recently watched this 1954 movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies price portrays don gallico a magicianinventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions and also his wife portrayed in a brief role by the lovely eva gabor even though price is a murderer i actually found myself rooting for him he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of himbr br although this movie doesnt have the horror factor of some of his more famous roles such as my favorite house of wax it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest br br this is a must for vincent price fans
this is essentially a variation on house of wax in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies vincent pricein both pictures he plays a talented artist who is sent toppling over the edge into insanity when his creations are usurped by otherless talented and less scrupulous people in this movie he plays a designer of illusions for stage magicians who aspires to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another illusionist the great rinaldo john emeryinsists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any illusions he designsprice is already ill disposed towards rinaldi as his former wife is now a paramour of rinaldi he deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant mimic to avenge himself upon rinaldi and others who thwart his plans for recognition as a performer and a designerbr br price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a wronged man whose predicament earns audience sympathythe rest of the cast are competent if colourless and the weight of the whole venture falls on price who carries the burden with ease br br good solid b movie melodrama  this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you dont expect a masterpiece shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic performance
basically the exact same movie as house of wax  vincent prices first genuine horror hit released the previous year  but seriously who cares because the mad magician offers just as many sheer thrills delightful period setpieces joyous 3d effects sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor never change a winning team is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down prices character don gallico another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history entitled the girl and the buzz saw gallicos promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose stating that all of gallicos inventions are the rightful property of the company the sleazy and relentless ormond who by the way also ransacked gallicos once beloved wife takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallicos rival the great rinaldi inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond but  also being a master of creating disguises  recreates his victims image and even starts leading a double life the mad magician is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50s horror movie in grand guignol style with a whole lot of improbably plot twists the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist and a handful of fantastically grotesque grossout moments although they obviously remain suggestive for most part the 3d delights near the beginning of the film like a yoyo player and a goofy trick with water fountains merely just serve as timefiller and contemporary 50s hype but its still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them the mad magician is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in like no other actor could ever accomplish price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way you pity don gallico yet at the same time you fear him enormously you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death vincent price simply was a genius actor and in my humble opinion the embodiment of the horror genre
the great vincent price has done many fantastic horror films some of which range among the greatest genre gems of alltime prices greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s with films such as roger cormans brilliant poecycle still the greatest horror cycle of alltime michael reeves witchfinder general 1968 or ubaldo ragonas the last man on earth 1964 marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant mans career the films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal horror icon he is however date back to the 50s with house of wax 1953 marking his rise to stardom the mad magician of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor this is not to say however that this film isnt an original delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself as the lines above may suggest vincent price is my favorite actor and while i personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gembr br price stars as don galico aka galico the great an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices whose boss a sleazy businessman stole his wife eva gabor from him when the boss takes away one of galicos ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival the great rinaldi john emery galico snaps and a murderous spree of revenge beginsbr br dont we love vincent price when hes out for revenge some of his most famous and greatest films such as the abominable dr phibes 1971 or theater of blood 1973 were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders and this earlier film in his horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as vincent price does this film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for price who as always delivers a brilliant performance and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every horror fan another mustsee for my fellow price fans
vincent prices followup to house of wax 1953 the film which cemented his reputation as a horror icon similarly revolves around a bitter  albeit resourceful  showman though a remake the former shot in technicolor remains the superior effort that said apart from some resistible comic relief the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry it was another 3d showcase and occasional narrative shortcomings whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head this offers more than enough grand guignoltype thrills and overall camp value price hamming it up in a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions impersonating missing star conjurers who had taken advantage of his genius to stand on its own two feet incidentally director brahms involvement here proves no mere coincidence  since the narrative incorporates elements from two horror titles both starring laird cregar he had previously helmed ie the lodger 1944 and hangover square 1945 the young leads are played by mary murphy as prices ingénue assistant and patrick oneal as her police detective boyfriend  curiously enough he would himself take the lead in a similar piece chamber of horrors 1966 which i have acquired just in time to serve as an encore to this one an interesting sideline here is the latters adoption of a novel detection technique fingerprinting which is crucial in bringing about prices downfall in a predictable but rather awkward fiery climax
the film begins with vincent price about to begin his performance as a magician however midway through the very successful show the police come and shut him down it seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks price had createdeven those he made on his own time at home as a result price justifiably kills the evil man the problem is that while the viewer understood why price killed and most probably thought this was a good thing because price was a bit mad he just couldnt stop at one sort of like eating lays potato chipsbr br the film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows great plot twists as well as exciting action one thing you cant say about this film is that it is dull while its also far from subtle it is fun throughout though and well worth a lookbr br had i never seen vincent prices version of house of wax i probably would have liked the mad magician a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9 thats because while the mad magician is a wonderful film its highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it house of wax the bottom line is that since house of wax was so successful the formula was rehashed in the followup film both were made in 3d both have a plot where price has every justification to kill but he cant stop once hes committed the first and both are great fun to watch the biggest differences and there are few are that house of wax was in color and was more of a horror film and the mad magician was definitely more of a mysterybr br my advice is to see this film and house of wax the price version only they are both terrific 1950s horror films
even though it has one of the standard revenge price plots this film is my favorite of vincent prices work gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters likeability when you watch it you feel for him you feel his frustration the injustices against him and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance even though he frightens you a little with his original fury as the film goes on his character becomes tragic hes committed his murder but now he must kill to cover that up and again to cover that one up and again your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood even if the revenge story is of old the plot devices themselves are original gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways a shame this one isnt available for home veiwing
i loved the real mc coys 19571963 it is too bad that lydia reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear she was excellent in the show of course walter brennan was great as well as tony martínez i loved it when he called amos señor grampai have purchased season i on dvd and i cannot wait to buy seasons 26if only there would be more shows on television like this one everything would be better this show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared god bless all the departed members of the cast and pleasellydia reed make yourself known again to the public you are loved and respected the real mc coys will live forever
although i didnt like stanley  iris tremendously as a film i did admire the acting jane fonda and robert de niro are great in this movie i havent always been a fan of fondas work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he cant care for him anymore that will break your heart i wouldnt really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment but i will say you wont see much bette acting anywhere
i really enjoyed the reunion a lot i would have rated it a 10 if they had had hassie and little luke there wasnt even a mention of where they are today or why they didnt participate in the reunion they were very popular characters and i think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearancebr br anyway i was glad that tnn ran the series again i had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series i may have missed a few episodes jenny hanahan
i watched the mccoys reunion and was glad to see richard crenna and kathleen nolan and tony martinezto see them now was wonderful because i always watched the show growing up so when the tv said that there was going to be a reunion i was so excited  the only thing i could not figure out is why lydia reed hassie mccoy and michael winkelmanlittle luke was not on therei know that walter brennan had died so i got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to lydia reed hassie mccoy and michael winkelman little luke i would be thankful i have searched everywere and no luck the only thing i could find out about michael winkelman is he was supposed to be born in 1946 this show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learnedthe shows today dont have thatthe whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them so since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do thank you glenda
fortunately for us real mccoy fans most likely all baby boomers who grewup in the late 50s and 60s three of the adult actorsactress appeared when they did for the reunion show in 2000 tony martinez and richard crenna both died shortly thereafter as enjoyable as it was to see luke sugarbabe and pepino together again it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of lydia reed and michael winkleman it is my understanding that little luke had passed away in 1999 but im not sure how there is no information about hassie on the internet that i can find very curious why they were not even mentioned it was so conspicuous their absence from the reunion show that i suspect that the family of michael and lydia herself if still alive either 1 requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted or 2 tnn could not find any trace of either michael or lydia like the rest of us they seemed to have vanished therefore it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all togetherbr br otherwise the retrospect on walter brennen was wonderfully done they made no bones about it  it was grandpa who made the show such a success i remember as a child mimicking grandpas gimp walk and my parents laughing as im sure a million other children did back then one annoyance that did bother me a bit was the tendency for richard crenna to dominate the discussion  at times interrupting tony and kathleen to make a point in fact although tony martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation he was not allowed to speakout and say too much during the reunion show unfortunate since i wanted to hear from all three equally all in all the reunion show was a real treat for me ive watched it on dvd several times and have enjoyed it each timebr br dodgerdude
a few years ago i added a comment to the imdb on the real mccoys tv series i said then and repeat now it was a charming funny and entertaining show wellacted with wonderful characterizationsbr br i recently saw on dvd four old episodes plus the reunion of 2000 with richard crenna kathy nolan and tony martinez as another writer here mentioned it is curious that lydia reed hassie and michael winkelman little luke werent refered to but perhaps they can be tracked down via sag or aftrabr br the reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show one piece of inside information we did not get was whether or not kathy nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute which left luke a widow in its last year which wasnt very good nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called broadside about women nurses in the pacific in ww ii get it broadside no not funnybr br unlike the sleazy salacious and violent trash on tv now that is so undermining our values the real mccoys entertained with decent values and fine human beings and i thank all involved including the creator irving pinkus for having brought it to my family we never missed it
i used this film in a religion class i was teaching the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment a young boy and his mother are away from home the boy has been given money to buy milk on the way home he stops at carnival to play a game next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary the boy drops the bottle of milk it breaks the man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk this scene alternates with what is happening at home a black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment he discovers the fish bowl and watches it the fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl by now a bunch of teenagers in my class and i have fallen in love with the fish the cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath the cat drops the fish into the bowl the double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat both inspire prejudice both are innocent it was a great discussion starter in my class
i saw this film while at birmingham southern college in 1975 when it was shown in combination with the red balloon both films are similar in their dreamlike quality the bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner a little boy is away at school a cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are and begins to warily stalk his prey the boy begins his walk home from school and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend the fish becomes agitated by the cats presence and finally jumps out of the bowl the cat quickly walks over to the fish gently picks him up with his paws and returns him to his bowl the boy returns happily to his fish none the wiserbr br the ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity it is hard to imagine how the director couldve pulled the technical feat back in 1959  it seems more a trick for 2003br br if you can find it watch it  you wont be disappointed and if you do find it let me know so i can get a copy too
i remember seeing this in a the salem movie theater where i used to attend kiddie matinées almost every saturday in dayton ohio when i was a young boy and have never forgotten it it simply amazed me and my friends i do wish there were some way i could see it again i have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail i only recently discovered that it was a cousteau film and that blew my mind even more how the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding the fish is actually in the cats mouth at one point if i remember correctly if anyone could help me find a way to see it again i would be extremely grateful
this academy award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre told completely without dialogue it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open after a while a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl the fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited as the cat comes very near to the bowl the fish jumps out the cat catches the fish drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy not knowing what has happened gets back this was amazingly filmed with real animals how cousteau got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable i only wish this film were available now for people to see i only saw it once in 1959 when it was originally released but it has remained unforgettable
this was one of the best movies i have seen the movie relates to real life and how drugs can play a major part although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget i found it to be exhilarating to watchbr br some may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction however when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters there is no direction is life i feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptationsbr br most of the cast are newcomers to the industry however they all pulled it off very well everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriatelybr br i think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control this movie might just scare them enough to change their ways
to be honest i had no idea what this movie was about when i started it thats how i watch movies whenever possible no preconception i thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something i was wrong kindabr br loaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me i know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not want to dobr br another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but i beg to differ these kinds of things do happen im sorry but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are implausible really sorry but the reality of the world is that they do happen the creator of this movie as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things can just go bad and how people can make really bad choices sometimes things turn out good sometimes they turn out bad and such is lifebr br i highly recommend this movie
very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves i can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write this film simply smacked of the real world the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter the livein relatives and their quarrels the troubled child who gets knocked up and then typically drops out of school a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it 2 thumbs up
yeah the poster is quite a horrible piece of workbr br i thought the movie was oknothing really outstandingi just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his lifebr br ahh but that cant happen to rich kids now can it not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansionbr br nothe kid is too good to have his life totally trashed after all who will drive the brand new suv and who will go to law school br br ah the poor little rich kidsin their quaint pretty house with their ivy league schools ultra clean homes and socialite partieswhat will the world do without them br br i hope they all get addicted to drugs passaway their life and end up in jailso maybe we can see movies that dont all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world
generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending the acting was spectacular and the characters didnt stray from their persons i especially liked the plot although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie however i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer extended maybe to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell for instance what happened to tristans brother hayden for all we know he died in the hospital maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing who knows maybe there will be a sequel maybe if there is i cant wait to see it
this is no arthouse film its mainstream entertainment br br lots of beautiful people ta and action i found it very entertaining its not supposed to be intellectually stimulating its a fun film to watch jesse and chace are funny too which is just gravy definitely worth a rentalbr br so in summary id recommend checking it out for a little friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl if she likes to see other girls get it onbr br the villains are good too vinnie corey large the hatian guy from heroes very nasty villains
my first child was born the year this program came out and i played the record album for the boys every christmas thereafter when the cd came out i bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start familiesit invariably becomes their favorite christmas album i recently found several dvds made on dvdr from video tapes probably for sale on ebay the one i bought was an excellent copy and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years there are some songs on the show that were not on the album and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show but both the cd and dvd will stay in our library as the best christmas entertainment ever
i am a huge john denver fan i have a large collection of his music on vinyl i saw this christmas special when it was originally on tv and loved it i have the original vinyl album and cd i have the original cd and later release the later release is missing several songs though i see that it has been released this year with all original songs to my surprise i found the original cd for sale at 7500 wow  to think that a christmas cd would be worth that much to me no amount is worth selling this treasure it is my favorite christmas cd i have never been able to find it on vhs or dvd i would love to have either version if anyone has one available please let me know thanks
yes i have a copy of it on vhs uncut in great condition that i transfered to dvd and if anyone one wants to bring back the memories of a christmas classic please emil me at dmd2222verizonneti searched everywhere and i found nothing on this and i thought that i cant be the only one on this planet that has this classic on tape there has to be other people and if they do i fit in with them being that very very few that has this classic so i consider myself lucky and i have all of the muppets christmas except one that john denver did with the muppets again i thinks its called a smokey mountain holiday im not to sure but its close
i was reviewing some old vhs tapes i have and came across the tv show john denver  the muppets a christmas togetherthis made me go to my computer and look it up to see if i could find a dvd version of this show to buy i was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on dvd the show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show i have the record and the cd but i would love to buy a dvd version of this show the tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading the sound is not as good as the cd there is also a few other songs not put on the cd as a fan of john denver and of the muppets a dvd of this show would really be a good seller if you dont have the cd it is a wonderful chritmas collection of songs taken from that show the album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on
this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd  since my 33 rpm got lostand any cassettes i made are also long gonebr br i am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music  which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin  esp little st nick   it also contained a few little known songs  original  br br even though it was done at the end of the 70s this show had a timeless feel to it hoping to find a copy soon 
for me too this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly in 1989 i snatched up the 2 cds i found of the soundtrack recording giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself its part of my familys christmas tradition now and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listenbr br it has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show and they did more than one special together the good rapport between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages
a christmas together actually came before my time but ive been raised on john denver and th
